Gonna make Bens now\\nFriend: How r u holding up?:)\\nPersona: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nPersona: eating lunch now\\nPersona: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nPersona: touched*\\nPersona: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nFriend: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nFriend: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nPersona: I'll show you next time we meet\\nPersona: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nPersona: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\\nPersona: lets try it\\nFriend: Nice\\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nPersona: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nPersona: For Ben and Carsten\\nPersona: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nPersona: I think its not clearly related\\nFriend: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nPersona: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nPersona: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nPersona: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nPersona: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nPersona: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nPersona: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nPersona: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nFriend: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nPersona: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nPersona: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nPersona: lets check if other have office hours\\nPersona: Rob also has on Monday...\\nPersona: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nPersona: hmm\\nPersona: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: But\\nFriend: No\\nPersona: if they get the one time pass, they wont get an actual pass generator\\nPersona: the pass generator key is like a private key thats never sent\\nFriend: Maybe they will\nIf they get your session cookie or something\\nFriend: And if they can refresh it\\nPersona: (of course if its http, then session cookie is risk)\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: yeah thats true\\nFriend: Unless site kicks you out even after active time\\nPersona: yeah I guess you can esily get hacked on http, that was too large of an assumption haha\\nFriend: XD\nThey wont steal your phone and the 2nd factor\\nPersona: but you get the point. Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one.

When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nFriend: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nPersona: I'll show you next time we meet\\nPersona: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nPersona: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nPersona: Send the same one twice\\nPersona: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nFriend: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nFriend: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\\nPersona: lets try it\\nFriend: Nice\\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nPersona: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nPersona: For Ben and Carsten\\nPersona: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nPersona: I think its not clearly related\\nFriend: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nPersona: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nPersona: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nPersona: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nPersona: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nPersona: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nPersona: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nPersona: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nFriend: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nPersona: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nPersona: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nPersona: lets check if other have office hours\\nPersona: Rob also has on Monday...\\nPersona: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nPersona: hmm\\nPersona: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: But\\nFriend: No\\nPersona: if they get the one time pass, they wont get an actual pass generator\\nPersona: the pass generator key is like a private key thats never sent\\nFriend: Maybe they will\nIf they get your session cookie or something\\nFriend: And if they can refresh it\\nPersona: (of course if its http, then session cookie is risk)\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: yeah thats true\\nFriend: Unless site kicks you out even after active time\\nPersona: yeah I guess you can esily get hacked on http, that was too large of an assumption haha\\nFriend: XD\nThey wont steal your phone and the 2nd factor\\nPersona: but you get the point. Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nPersona: ok nvm I just read it\\nPersona: lets try it\\nFriend: Nice\\nPersona: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nPersona: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nPersona: For Ben and Carsten\\nPersona: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nPersona: I think its not clearly related\\nFriend: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nPersona: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nPersona: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nPersona: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nPersona: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nPersona: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nPersona: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nPersona: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nFriend: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nPersona: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nPersona: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nPersona: lets check if other have office hours\\nPersona: Rob also has on Monday...\\nPersona: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nPersona: hmm\\nPersona: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: But\\nFriend: No\\nPersona: if they get the one time pass, they wont get an actual pass generator\\nPersona: the pass generator key is like a private key thats never sent\\nFriend: Maybe they will\nIf they get your session cookie or something\\nFriend: And if they can refresh it\\nPersona: (of course if its http, then session cookie is risk)\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: yeah thats true\\nFriend: Unless site kicks you out even after active time\\nPersona: yeah I guess you can esily get hacked on http, that was too large of an assumption haha\\nFriend: XD\nThey wont steal your phone and the 2nd factor\\nPersona: but you get the point. Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nPersona: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nPersona: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nPersona: lets check if other have office hours\\nPersona: Rob also has on Monday...\\nPersona: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nPersona: hmm\\nPersona: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: But\\nFriend: No\\nPersona: if they get the one time pass, they wont get an actual pass generator\\nPersona: the pass generator key is like a private key thats never sent\\nFriend: Maybe they will\nIf they get your session cookie or something\\nFriend: And if they can refresh it\\nPersona: (of course if its http, then session cookie is risk)\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: yeah thats true\\nFriend: Unless site kicks you out even after active time\\nPersona: yeah I guess you can esily get hacked on http, that was too large of an assumption haha\\nFriend: XD\nThey wont steal your phone and the 2nd factor\\nPersona: but you get the point. Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one.

When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one. Local website loads 5-10x faster.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"

Its like so secure 1) the transmitted part always changes 2) its unique for diff website by default 3) the generator hash is long and complex usually\\nPersona: I wonder how much 6 digit digests and timestamp pairs to crack a 2FA pass\\nPersona: Maybe if you get like 100 pairs you can solve the equation\\nFriend: Whays a timestamp pair\\nPersona: u know how a 2FA works behind the hood?\\nFriend: Yahoo fkin after entering my ex email twice wrongly locked password reset for some time\\nFriend: Cause it shows you part of email and you have to enter it wholy\\nFriend: Like you have a limited time to enter that code?\\nPersona: When you make a 2FA, the website gives you a generatorkey and keeps a copy for itself that is never shared again. Then you 2FA app has a function getOneTimePass(generatorKey, getCurrentTime())\\nPersona: The function uses the generator key and current timestamp to generate a one time key\\nPersona: thats why the one time key always changes\\nPersona: do maybe if you have like many pairs, you can crack the generatorKey\\nPersona: now or a past thing?\\nPersona: btw I just made this up from how I think it works, it may be different\\nPersona: But thats how I understood it works atleast\\nPersona: I think its TOPT, not 2FA i am refering to\\nPersona: TOTP*\\nPersona: time based one time pass\\nPersona: but yeah I am correct I  guess\\nPersona: U use Autohotkey?\\nPersona: I didn't notice but my ahk script has grown to just 70 lines short of 1000\\nPersona: I can only guess how much time it saved me\\nFriend: I tried to script some stuff for cabal but they somehow prevent non human key input\\nFriend: Idk how\\nFriend: What stuff you have in your script\\nFriend: 1000 lines is a lot for ahk\\nFriend: My most used script is like 15\\nPersona: a lot of it is for MindManager\\nPersona: also a lot of it might be not optimal, but if it works and it works fast, then whatever\\nPersona: I actua;ly have so many I made a help messsage box shortcut lol\\nPersona: !h::\nMsgBox, \n(\nAvailable Shortcuts for MindManager:\n\nAlt + Z - Consolas\nAlt + A - Open color selection\nAlt + L (or W) - Link two topics together\nCtrl + Shift + G - Grey\nCtrl + Shift + T - Tree layout\nCtrl + Shift + M (or E) - Map layout\nCtrl + Shift + K - Paste as Link\nAlt + Down - Split Below\nAlt + Up - Split Above\nCtrl + Alt + Left - Merge left\nCtrl + Alt + Right - Merge right\nCtrl + Shift + Down - Merge Below\nCtrl + Shift + Up - Merge Above\nAlt + Q - Quotes\nAlt + S - Disable spellchek\nCtril + Shift + S - Add to dict word below curson\nAlt + E - Capitalize\nAlt + R - Rectangle\nCtrl + 1 - Go to checkpoint 1\nCtrl + Shift + 1 - Set checkpoint 1\n\n)\\nFriend: Oh you overwrote some?\\nFriend: I think ctrl enter makes sub item\\nFriend: Split brlow\\nFriend: Idk if same\\nFriend: Checkpoint \n\nHave to get mindmanager on secondary laptop\\nFriend: Tried learning obsidian but shits hard\\nFriend: You can do complicated stuff\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: nice tldr\\nPersona: what kind of academic knowledge did you use?\\nFriend: not very passionate about it. Maybe because I didn't work there and was participating in writing from the sidelines\\nPersona: ah yeah, note taken, thanks\\nPersona: What topic would you chosoe now if u could again?\\nFriend: we didn't go much into automating this. I think we can do an analysis comparing both scenarios. Like a risk benefit\n\nBecause requirements change a lot I don't think a fully IT system solution would work out\n\nbut maybe a mix of both\n\nwe have a bit of statistic on which information is entered wrong and we use interviews to find out why it's wrong\\nFriend: some of it is because it bears no meaning for the one entering so they don't really care\n\nothers is just hard to find and enter\n\nso we use interviews and stats to find out which pieces of information are wrong why\n\nand see with the bosses also which pieces are how important to collect\\nFriend: I shouldn't have listened to Jens that the metro project is too theoretical imo\n\njust go into something I like\n\nbecause then I would've put more work and more quality (at least in my view)\\nFriend: but maybe this gets us a good grade. It's more meta\nI would probably be better off doing this\\nFriend: I wanted to write about different ways to choose where to build a new metro line (what would be best, for people, stakeholders etc)\n\ndifferent ways to choose\\nPersona: my view matches\\nFriend: have a really cool book at work with opinions of smart or famous people on what matters for the metro system in CPH\n\nso some view it from the impact it has on culture\n\nsome are about connection (also with Sweden) or jobs \n\nor access for people to different ammenities\\nPersona: if grade > knowedge & Xp & motivation\\nFriend: yeah.. that's why I joined BEIT\nI should've put more work for the grade\\nPersona: that sounds interesting\\nFriend: I hope motivation doesn't stop after studies\nThen there would be so much more time to pursue maybe\\nPersona: finding what causes people input errors as a concept is also fun, but maybe it was the other thigns that made it not fun\\nPersona: okay yeah so grade might be better if it leads to open doors to great places - like great unis and great network. Perhaps these great places could result in more knowledge & XP & motivation\\nPersona: fucking grades\\nPersona: called a phone today with autosvar and understood some of the robot message in danish. Feeling satisfied\\nFriend: that would be the dream. I am not sure if my parents just have extraordinary motivation or have found that sweet place\n\ncause they work super hard\n\nand it's real fun going with them meeting ppl they work with in some way from other cities\\nFriend: we had new years with 2 other fams from other cities that also have stores and it's real cool when they talk work on the table\\nFriend: and strategise\\nFriend: it's like PRUN\\nFriend: thinking what strengths they have and the market and what to focus on or to make deals with others\\nFriend: prun irl is the dream\\nFriend: are you studying it somehow? classes?\\nFriend: it's a good achievement\\nPersona: :OO\\nPersona: thats nice\\nPersona: yeap\\nPersona: yeah took courses\\nPersona: made 700 anki cards\\nPersona: I do them on the bus on the way to work\\nPersona: giga easy to memorize\\nPersona: the only masters to get in without engineering bsc\\nPersona: But the courses are not that technical\\nPersona: Looks lit af\\nPersona: Honestly just positioning yourself 2 years at DTU skylab is phenomenal\\nPersona: LinkedIn is so good\\nPersona: The video does not say the last name\\nPersona: but based on the info about the person I found her\\nPersona: I searched the first name, then name of the DTU course and Tesla\\nPersona: popped the first\\nPersona: building network\\nFriend: Detective :D\\nPersona: Are u in dk?\\nFriend: yeah!\n\nPatryk asked me to go out friday but you had only 1 spacei n thr group\\nFriend: I wanna take Laura with\\nFriend: im having final exam tomorrow also\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: damn\\nPersona: never flown such a place\\nFriend: in this windy ass weather\\nFriend: i will die\\nPersona: its cause airports are always windy\\nPersona: they are apparently very open xd\\nFriend: nooo i am serious it\u2019s so windy here today\\nFriend: i was riding in the arena and couldn\u2019t see bc i had so much sand in my eyes\\nPersona: damn okay thats rough\\nPersona: Anyways, I'll go back stalking BP and you enjoy your flight\\nFriend: thanks wish me luck \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: Good luck!\ud83e\udd47\\nPersona: Hey, how should we work today?\\nFriend: do you want to meet in person or just call?\\nPersona: Are you going to be at cbs today?\\nFriend: not if i don\u2019t need to buy we can meet there is you want?\\nPersona: Okay we can just call then\\nPersona: But I am atill at home so I'll call you when I get there and start working in ~1hr\\nPersona: is that okay?\\nPersona: Well I am ready, just tell me when we should call\\nPersona: but don't call me haha, everyone will start looking at me \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: since I have an exception on call when silent mode\\nFriend: haha okay\\nFriend: i will just read the Dong energy/\u00d8rsted example that was provided on canvas bc they are doing some og the same things as we are\\nPersona: okay, can you send it to me?\\nPersona: if you can\\nFriend: if that doesent work its in canvas\\nPersona: thanks\\nPersona: I think i will also analyze the websites restoregulf.com and DeepWaterHorizonResponse.com made by BP\\nPersona: as that was the main tool they used to communicate to their stakeholders\\nPersona: I will analyze it at the two periods\\nPersona: by the way, are we aligned on the periods?\\nFriend: ok that sounds like a good idea\\nFriend: remember to keep it short\\nFriend: we need to do some sort of content, framing and discourse analysis on the communication '\\nFriend: in order to say something about how they communicated\\nFriend: what periods did you say?\\nFriend: we need to pick only a few mediums\\nPersona: About the framing we need to call about that\\nPersona: Cause i am not analyzing framing\\nPersona: Okay idk about the websites, the website apparently was taken over by the US governemnt later in 2010, so its not their communication anymore\\nFriend: how are you ana\u00e6yzing?\\nPersona: I have outlined the stakes of each stakeholder and what information they are seeking regarding the way the oil spill challenged their stake.\\nPersona: So I've mane two qustions for each stakeholder\\nPersona: And I am seeing whether BP in the timeframe addresses those questions\\nPersona: Okay I have clarified that the website is partly overseen by BP\\nPersona: the reason why I have to add more sources is because they communicate differently across the channels\\nPersona: i.e. they communicate much more info about safety on their website rather than twitter\\nPersona: and neither the website neither twitter has anything for shareholders\\nFriend: okay but thats really good. I think we could structure it the way they do in the example to keep it clear and straight forward. I will just try to make the structure in the document so you can see what i mean\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I talk quick.and fast w/you\\nPersona: xdd\\nPersona: in case you till.not sure\\nPersona: confirmation confirmed\\nFriend: you can write my roomie and stuff in case im busy driving focused\\nFriend: made group\\nPersona: alrihht\\nFriend: I'll go pick up and be at your place in 25min maybe\\nPersona: alright\\nFriend: Comin\\nPersona: Lright im walkinf out\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f called you.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nPersona: You called \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f.\\nFriend: cape god is the album from allie x\\nFriend: btw if you remember where i left my phone last it would be of great help\\nPersona: Hmm, sofa?\\nPersona: Table near sofa?\\nFriend: ;cc didnt see\\nPersona: my pockets are empty\\nFriend: maybe put in trash? idk\\nPersona: Xddddd\\nFriend: will check there\\nPersona: call?\\nFriend: battery out\\nPersona: ab\\nFriend: cause it had 3 %\\nPersona: ah\\nPersona: But it should be home\\nFriend: ill see but thx\\nFriend: good day today?\\nPersona: I saw some phone in case on the sofa table\\nPersona: Maybe Artemis room?\\nPersona: Yeah, very nice wholesome day \u2764\\nPersona: Wby?

Also pick a surprising one. The problem was that for me I did not learn anything very interesting from the speeches, maybe a little bit about gen-z and founder-investor relationship regarding health, but didn't listen attentively enough to share some thought. I tried to do some research with chatgpt about that topic and pretend I heard it in techbbq, but didn;t work well\\nPersona: So I will need to listen more attentively next time to share some idea I heard\\nPersona: 2 PCS 1 MOUSE\\nPersona: WTF\\nPersona: mac is cool\\nPersona: Migrated to m1 chip from the old one.

Probably has no idea about its value.\\nPersona: says non-negaotiable, but maybe depensing on the specs inside I could bargain the PC cheaper and not take the other stuff. When I asked for specs, he reply that he is not sure, but I can come today check it out. I wonder if its worth it\\nPersona: The 2000kr pc is not responding to me neither on dba nor sms so yeah\\nPersona: Xdd\\nPersona: you getting this? xdd\\nFriend: Yeah bro that's an amazing deal\\nFriend: niceee! you are the master of first contact\\nFriend: in my honest opinion\\nPersona: im getting that pc for 1600 tommorow\\nPersona: the person replied\\nFriend: no more than 5 min xdddd\\nFriend: you can do 3 portions for 3 days\\nPersona: Do you think he is bluffing?\\nFriend: Nahh\\nFriend: He is real\\nPersona: I offered 1850.

There are so many publishers, all their website differents, then libraries etc. also so confusing. But sci-hub, which is illegal pirate academia site, yuu literally just put in the DOI, you get article instantly. NO CLUTTER at all. Absolutely clear users experience and you can get almost any paper there.\\nFriend: damn have a lot of reading to catch up to\\nFriend: i came back today from trip and nolifed to now\\nPersona: Cabal?\\nFriend: Yewp\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: Wtf\nIn company relationships allowed?\\nFriend: You gonna pass me in web knowledge in a second\\nFriend: \ud83d\udda4\\nFriend: Weird flex\nWould make me feel not unique xD\\nFriend: What that\\nFriend: Yeah when things get standartised it can be ez to make nice stuff\\nFriend: But standards need to be updateable\n\nI dislike we dont have barcodes with more info on them the standard\\nFriend: They are just an id for now\nId for a product\\nPersona: xxdd they came to work there already hooked up. But yes, relationships enabled\\nPersona: yeah that, but also, what healthy person keeps track of how many persons he met from each country? Especially when the number is as high as 19.\\nPersona: people would assume a serial killer or.smth xdd\\nPersona: but isnt that the most optimal?\\nPersona: ID looks ups the rest of the data which could be megabytes in size, as much as you wish\\nPersona: you cannot even put a kylobyte on the barcode\\nFriend: Add a seconnd fact\n\"I got drunk with 10 of them\"\\nFriend: Then less weird\\nPersona: thats probably true\\nFriend: Yeh but for each bach of that product there are expirations and whatnot\nWould help both store and apps for ppl\\nPersona: But Youtube Music or Spotify as a standard is pretty satisfactory I think. Its much better than having to.keep track of each music producer/store, buy songs with separate UI's etc. \n\nMusic streaming industry still needs some opening up tho for even better UX innovation. I think the entry barriers are so big.\n\nSome standard are indeed shit, but some can be good.\\nPersona: Oh so its literally the data for.this instance of product you need\\nPersona: yeah I guess batch ID would be nice to have in addition.\\nPersona: Having the expiry date, produced date and manufacturer on the barcode explicitly I see would make it open to end users, but if shops are willing to open source their batch id to detail lookup db's, the issue would be solved more optimally.\\nPersona: Since rither Standards or the laws to make specific details open source are set by government, I would just go with batch id and then force shops to open source look ups.\\nFriend: If you go for president\nYou have my vote\\nFriend: I like government intervention in some cases\\nPersona: how was summer house trip?\\nFriend: Because companies dont have big incentive here\\nFriend: Been good\nLots of photos and good time with her and her mom\\nFriend: Was fuunny when we played mini golf\\nPersona: You stayed there whole.week?\\nPersona: i see only things kicking off with Laura real well\\nFriend: ye\n\nand here when we played gold there is this hole from circles\\nFriend: they go a bit down\\nFriend: and I thought ill jump from first to the last\\nFriend: so I hit strong so ball can jump\\nFriend: but it didnt jump up, it went forward hard\n\nand when it hit the small course wall, it flew backwards\\nFriend: like fucking pinball \nit went through other players with a dog\\nFriend: dog got super excited for flying ball\\nFriend: and then it hit a car in the parking lot\\nFriend: im an idiot xD but was funny af\\nPersona: i cant conceive\\nPersona: it this a wall\\nPersona: is*\\nFriend: the little bricks"
