I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"

I also apprexiate you. You are always smiling and kind, you deserve a lot from this life. I hope we will meet each other very soon. I will come to Copenhagen !!! Or you can come to Berlin or Bulgaria again, we will be in touch !!!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama. I think u should check that Reddit sub out;)\\nFriend: I thought about the three topics and actually had some better understanding, I really recomend you doing it, we can share our thoughts on friday\\nFriend: I also ran my answers through gpt4, not super on-point thesis suggestions, but now bad. Maybe we can combine our both answers and then run it thorough chat gpt haha\\nPersona: Ill check it tmr morning (I\u2019m a bit tipsy rn:))\\nFriend: ahahah okay\\nFriend: have fun mate\\nFriend: hey mate I really overslept, lets do it 11ish\\nPersona: We can easily do later if u want:)\\nFriend: alright, so 11 would be nice\\nPersona: All right. I\u2019ll arrive at my unit shortly, so I can do this before we meet;)\\nPersona: I can't access it...\\nFriend: go to canvas bachelor project activities course\\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: u at egmont?\\nPersona: No, at Emma\u2019s\\nFriend: ah okay, nvm, have fun then\\nPersona: U2;)\\nFriend: Elias, what is your plan tonight?\\nPersona: I\u2019m in a summerhouse in Jylland:)\\nPersona: What r u doing tonight? I\u2019m gonna go 2 my parents 4 dinner\\nFriend: Not sure, I might be meeting someone. When are you going?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: Are they in cph?\\nPersona: Around 20-ish in cph\\nFriend: okay I will tell you in a bit\\nFriend: I have a date with one girl and she is leaving for Italy soon, it sucks that its on the same day. I really appreciate the invite\\nFriend: Please let me know the next time too\\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Smth our tutors planned. Last 1 was pretty fun, and there was literally unlimited food and snacks\\nFriend: Ah I see I'll go there as well. When do you have lessons on Friday?\\nFriend: aibr21ab@student.cbs.dk\\nFriend: We could meet next Monday, actually discuss properly how to share the notes. Also I am sorry, this really got out of my head :D\\nFriend: Or this friday, but when is are your lessons?\\nPersona: Done at 15 friday\\nPersona: Sounds good with monday. I have a big gap between 9.40-14.25:)\\nPersona: No worries, don\u2019t stress about it\\nPersona: So tmr or Monday?\\nFriend: Maybe tommorow at 10?\\nPersona: Sure\\nFriend: fuck did I say 10\\nFriend: Did you have MCMR yet?\\nPersona: No\\nPersona: It\u2019s at 13.30 4 me\\nFriend: I have MCMR now and I got confused, do you want to take MCMR now and then go after that? :D\\nFriend: Cause you can mix it\\nFriend: I sometimes go to later lessons\\nPersona: When is that and where?\\nFriend: right now\\nFriend: 0.46\\nPersona: Coming\\nFriend: sorry for mixing it up bro \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: but join the class now\\nFriend: just skip the later one\\nFriend: Are you coming? You okay?\\nPersona: I am here\\nPersona: U have ML afterwards?\\nFriend: where? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: i never seen you in the clasa\\nFriend: today\\nPersona: What gmail do u have connected 2 your google drive?\\nPersona: Also, would u send the code/python mindmap plz? I think it will help me a lot:)\\nFriend: Ninjatxgaming@gmail.com \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Yes, sure' I'll do that shortly\\nFriend: Here's the python mmap\\nFriend: Yeah sorry the attachment failed to send\\nFriend: By the way, I have some new notes, but from previous lessons,on which I had to catch up. I marked them how we discussed, see if the technique works\\nFriend: Perfect, now as soon as you update any of your mindmaps in the cloud, I will immediately have them on my PC latest version\\nFriend: By the way, the CRM mmap is 155mb, that's unusual\\nFriend: Othervise nice work putting it ont he cloud\\nFriend: Try to download google drive on your computer, this will auto upload it to cloud as well.\\nFriend: Let me know if you need help with that, I been using Google Drive a lot and know my way around there\\nPersona: That\u2019s a lot?\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check everything tmr:)\\nFriend: My whole DM map takes only 11mb and that has some great number of images\\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book? I found out how I did\\nPersona: This is the MIO book converted 2 word (from PDF)\\nPersona: Here is the auto generated Mindmap, when importing it\\nPersona: I also have an add-on 2 our note-sharing that I\u2019d like 2 hear your opinion about sometime\\nFriend: Sure!\\nFriend: I'll check it out\\nFriend: Hey, out date marking may not be very good as on the last day of the month, say 30 or 31st, we give each other only one day to catch up. Perhaps lets do month and day? See later how that works out, if its too much clutter, we can do it differently.\\nFriend: Also whenever we add smth that is up for sharing, lets give a quick update in messenger\\nFriend: like\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning about previous readings, PCA - date:9\\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol"
