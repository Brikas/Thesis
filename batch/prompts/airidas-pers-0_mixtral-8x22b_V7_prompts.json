So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: but happy for you!\\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\\nPersona: and the problem with not talking is thay it is embarassing for me\\nPersona: for example, if its a school break - I have to talk. If I just stand here and dont talk - I am a lower tier individual.\\nPersona: lets skip this topic for now, I dont want to convince you of anything, I probably cant anyways. I just know thats this is the way for me personally now\\nPersona: btw, what fun did you have awake at 3AM before Monday morning \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: ah okay. yup, it rings a bell\\nFriend: what do you mean?\\nFriend: hahah this does sound exactly like the inner monologue I would expect a sales person to have\\nPersona: When one makes it big in life through STEM with the trade-off of being socially akward, then atleast it was worth it. If one is just socially akward without making it big, then why? Would better be social and enjoy the life seen in movies.\\nPersona: I would low-key like to be like the technical co-founder billionaires, who got a lot of money being nerdy and now they are super rich but awkward. Yet, when you have big money to spend you have a social life in easy mode.\\nPersona: I gotta tell you its a nice feeling. But I remember even when I had this mysterious abilitiy, it ceased to activate when work time ended. So for example when its 17 o' clock and the friday bar opens, I no longer have automatic conversations. Perhaps because I feel the pressure to do it.\\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: no worries haha\\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05"

Then I agree.\\nPersona: You'll never know. Maybe in our families there is someone who thinks poop knife is a thing, but it never came to light yet. There is a unexplainable noise in the bacteria sickness among families statistics.\\nFriend: this is an investigation that needs to happen, but I heve yet to decide how to conduct it\\nFriend: do you know the whole picture? it's even better. it's a nun who's quite...explicit about her hobbies\\nFriend: wait, where is it\\nFriend: no idea what's up with that muppet in the background though\\nFriend: I'm willing to bet real-life money that someone at '5 minutes crafts' headquarters has pitched that idea at one point or another\\nPersona: btw, are you not sleeping?\\nPersona: Me, Denis and his wife are playing poker downstairs, do you want to join?\\nPersona: Go to kitchen of homes and check bathrooms. Is there a knife hanging in a bathroom? Then make a table, average bacteria sickness per year/ per capita in household. Then run regression and see if there is a correllation\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: She forgot her bra xdd\\nPersona: I can see the whole story here lol\\nPersona: Its good. Very effective. I swear, you will never lose the page you last stopped reading at\\nFriend: oh thank you, but I have shit ton of work to do before tomorrow\\nFriend: considering you use a communal kitchen, I'd advise you to take your own advice first. that would at least explain people visiting your kitchen at odd hours in the middle of the night \ud83d\udc40\\nFriend: thd penis rosary is so bomb I can't believe it's a 16th century invention\\nFriend: please enlighten me because I don't\\nFriend: the unrealised potential here bothers me a lot though. why stop at bookmark. you just need a few more condiments and you've got yourself a beautiful brand-new set of highlights\\nFriend: highlighters*\\nPersona: oh yeah, those freaks running with their pants down the hallway at midnight for that one rusty knife is definetely smth I should investigate. I always thought its a normal occurance in Tingbjerg dorm.\\nPersona: damn this even has a name. You know too much about religion haha\\nPersona: Mupped and madam had a fun time until the cat suddenly made her special penis kidnapping move. In the moment, the dude's post nut clarity enlightened him, that he shall not fuck around with them cat-penis-thieve cursed women, so he ceremoniuosly forsaken  his last womanly object and became a priest afterwards.\\nPersona: what a back story\\nPersona: mustard is next in line. That way we are sustainable, even in highlighting efforts\\nPersona: although idk where the fish comes in. Maybe you have an idea\\nFriend: welp, freaks are getting out of hand. looks like someone has dropped grandma's ashes on the ground floor\\nFriend: it has a name because I've just made it up. but it has a nice ring to it, might be patent-worthy\\nFriend: he's about to change career paths from court jester to priest? so inspiring \ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\udc4f but look, despite that internal turmoil, he's still holding the lady's purse while she's hunting for her dick. a true gentleman\\nFriend: got you. she came prepared. the fish must've been inside the purse. you see that writing in the right bottom corner? it means 'meat makes meat' or sth. the cat's a mob boss. sends that message once in a while to signal that he'll soon come back to extort some fish\\nFriend: I'm just starting to realize that I'm not a condiment expert. do we have access to more colours than those two?\\nPersona: Its a purse? This object is so weird.\\nPersona: faaaak, I should keep some fish at hand in case the mafia cat comes for me. Lucky cats are not allowed in this dorm\\nPersona: There is mayo, chilli mayo. But we can unlock a whole new part of the spectrum if we consider jams, chacolate toppings.\\nFriend: I'm not sure either, but it's the closest association I can think of\\nFriend: yes, thank god, mob bosses are known to be stopped by laws and regulations \ud83d\ude4f actually there used to be that one shifty looking fella walking around the gardens, but I haven't seen him or her in a while\\nFriend: which is equally probable to be a good or a bad sign\\nFriend: excuse you, MAYO?! did you use white crayons as a child as well?\\nPersona: ughh they looking for their next treasure to conquer. I am infamous for taking my long trips from the shower to the closet half naked, so I am probably at the top of the hit list\\nPersona: white crayons were always mystical to me. I never used them but I have always revered its secret powers\\nFriend: yup, your days are numbered then. stock up on fish and befriend a court jester to look after your possessions before it's too late\\nFriend: that's a nice euphemism. from now on, instead of admitting that I'm useless, I'll just claim I have secret powers\\nPersona: You are in the most strategic position to look after my possessions. In case of an emergency where you can save only three items, make sure you grab my speaker, a blue Monster from the fridge, and some other absolutely essential item of your choice.\\nPersona: Can I trust you on that?\\nPersona: You have just insulted the white crayon. Gods will not forgive.\\nPersona: oh and you are allowed to quickly finish the Soplica, in case there is still some left. Think of it as compensation\\nFriend: I can't believe you thought about blue monster from the fridge before you thought about your cactus. man, you're heartless\\nFriend: I'm reporting you for plant abuse!!\\nFriend: if the white crayon was made in the image of its gods, the gods must be not particularly mighty. I'm not scared\\nFriend: trusting sober me with your possessions was already an unwise move. but trusting drunk me with your possessions? I don't even know what to say\\nPersona: So take it as a third then. You see, thats why I need you. You think of the cactuses and other actually important things\\nPersona: Trusting you sober is already a good idea\\nFriend: stop it. now you're making it seem like I don't have secret powers :c\\nPersona: you probably do, when you get that exact amount of SOP\\nPersona: Soplica Alcohol Level\\nPersona: Also was just about to ask you, do you want to hang out on Saturday? Denis and his wife are coming over and I showed them the kittens game, they want to play it again. Its actually much more fun with 4 people\\nFriend: uh oh, perhaps the white crayon just struggles with an alcohol problem then.I would like to take all the mean things I said back\\nFriend: sure! that sounds fun\\nPersona: Its white as milk, that's the clue\\nPersona: I will update you on what time. Now I gotta prepare for an exam on Friday \ud83e\udd74\\nPersona: But probably in the evening, cause his wife works on that day I think\\nFriend: is that how it works? at least now I know why I'm so pale \ud83d\ude22\\nFriend: it's okay. I'm not in a rush to know\\nFriend: good luck!!\\nPersona: Are you so pale? At least I haven't noticed\\nPersona: I need luck, my oral examiner is infamous for throwing completely tangential, weird questions. Thanks\\nFriend: yup. I could easily become a poster child for anemia if my current career path doesn't work out\\nFriend: oof, this already gives me Vietnam flashbacks from mine. take all the luck then\\nPersona: Or you are a vampire \ud83d\ude32\\nPersona: Do you also crave for blood sometimes? You got really excited and curiuos when I said I cant handle knowing I am loosing blood. \ud83e\udd2d That may be a symptom of vampirism.\\nPersona: btw about Saturday, Denis finishes work at 23, so they want to come this late \ud83d\ude44\\nPersona: but we can meet earlier\\nFriend: wait, wasn't it with you that I was talking about sleeping in a coffin? or am I mixing up convos? I'm not even trying to hide my true identity at this point\\nFriend: very inopportune time to start wars. yeah let's do that\\nFriend: that I mean"

I've never felt more betrayed\\nPersona: Looks like Hermione has her side of savageness huh\\nPersona: I think Tyler Durden is the least concerned about how cool he seems or how anything he seems. Best thing Tyler taught me is to care less about the image. But I am not particularly good at this\\nPersona: And I totally agree, Tyler would be horrible to live with. He is the definition of unorderly. I am pretty sure Hermione has him under some spell.\\nPersona: But also tell me what did your pop-eyed combo instill in you?\\nFriend: I actually wouldn't be so sure about that. I think now all I see in that carelessness is a perfectly crafted picture projected with the very purpose of impressing others. after all, wasn't he the idealized version of all that Joe? Jack? - whatever his name was - ever wanted to be?\\nFriend: I believe that to be an illusion\\nFriend: although I must admit that to this man I owe a rather nonchalant attitude towards my belongings which I'm quite grateful for\\nPersona: He was an idealized way of the narrator (he had no name) like you say, but rather in a different way. To quote Tyler, he was free in every way that the narrator wished he was free. Take the blowing up of his condo as an example.\\nPersona: I see you have paid attention in the film, makes me feel good hearing that.\\nPersona: To my little embarrassment I am still yet to watch pt3 of back to the future \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: well this is not reliable, it's Tyler in the words of Tyler - he perceives himself to be free and wants to be perceived as such, doesn't mean that he is\\nFriend: I can see his behaviour as freedom when you use the narrator as the point of reference, yet I think he is a slave to his own need to prove that he's so outside of the box\\nFriend: in other words, I see him as a victim to  'I'm not like other girls' syndrome haha\\nFriend: oh man, I've seen it when I was 12 or something. I thought I discovered the meaning of life \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: you're still better than me! I haven't even seen the 2nd one\\nPersona: you're making me think so hard about this now \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: woke up my brain really well\\nPersona: It indeed came from his own lips and Tyler took quite an antagonist role in the end of the story, so thats a good point.\\nPersona: When you put him in 'I'm not like the other girls' analogy, I see how he could be trying to be different from our point of view. I might be wrong and often I am in these topics, but I think in his world, he has no concept of 'the other girls'. I think this is the kind of freedom he messages - losing the pressure from the others, so you can be anything you want to be.\\nPersona: The other part of the story, Project Mayhem, is something I yet dont fully understand, despite watching 5+ times. Tyler seemed to have criticized society as a whole and wanted some sort of chaos. Thus, we could argue that by apprearing different in the way you interpret, he attracted himself attention and capitalized on that by building a protesting empire."

So getting it right or wrong is big for me.\\nPersona: Also add Simulations to it\\nPersona: \ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\ud83e\udd1e\\nPersona: hoping with my whole three hands you get it\\nFriend: I'll be honest. I have no idea what I've just read \ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: but happy for you!\\nPersona: yeah its just my notes of named topics, we haven't picked a topic yet\\nFriend: no no, I know. I mean that I have little to no understanding of these topics\\nFriend: except for game theory perhaps, as long as it's the same game theory I'm thinking about\\nFriend: yeah no, that I totally get. that's what the past 6 months of my life have been all about basically\\nPersona: I would love to explain them to you. Business topics are not as hard than science-science in my opinion\\nPersona: I think it is what you are thinking about it, however, if we go with it, we would like to stay away from political aplications\\nPersona: and in retrospect, what you think of your topic choice?\\nPersona: I am actually conciously trying to train faster, intuitive decision making. As a wannabe founder this is very important, but its so hard when I've been taught to prioritize rationality, reasoning, seeking more information\\nFriend: oh no, it's the complete opposite for me. I guess I'm capable of comprehending those things, but it just goes into one ear and out of the other immediately. ask me a week later and I'll have no recollection of anything you said haha\\nFriend: I still love the topic, but was very wrong about the type of work I want to do. all my life I thought that since I'm more introverted, sth focused on data analysis would be good for me. turns out I'm far more social than I thought. sitting all day everyday in front of a screen made me absolutely miserable throughout that year\\nFriend: do you think the former is better? while I understand that it's important to be able to just take actions, because you wouldn't get anything done otherwise, I also believe that the issue with a lot of ent is just they're quite detached from reality. most of them fail after all\\nPersona: Then I shall tell it to each ear separetely\\nPersona: because data analysis was not fun enough or overall because not much human connection in front of the screen? There are some types of work, infamously what I did in my previous job, that was purely in front of the screen and purely of introvertive nature, that I was suprer miserable for two years. But then in other work I can absolutely thrive not talking to anyone and just working. Just to give you a perspective\\nPersona: My prev. job was translating SoMe texts from English to Lithuanian. I am just disgusted by the thought of it now, I could not focus, I kept checking phone every 5 mins, etc. But when it comes to programming, I literally forget other ppl exist, time passes instantly.\\nPersona: Of course you have to use a lot of logical thinking still. I think there may be multiple reasons why being able to make gut decisions can be really good for a founder. I came to realize this after having a mentoring session with one lady. And trust me, my mind at first was really against what she told me. But it also maybe more applicable to startup world, not sure of sciece world. Would love to tell you more about that too\\nPersona: I'll need to discover a way to close a leak in your ears when telling you those things haha\\nFriend: hm most of the time I was either reading papers, coding or writing, and really enjoyed each, time was passing almost too fast. yet it definitely felt like I was reliving the same day 250 times + that project was an old one, from pre-covid times, so I was rather detached from what everyone else was doing. and I'm driven not so much by achievements, but rather by passion and that childlike sense of awe about the world. if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth, it def dampens my spirit quite a bit and I tend to become disinterested\\nFriend: also I cannot be left alone for too long or my brain switches from outward mode to inward mode, and I get very weird very quickly haha. I kind of forget how to be a person\\nFriend: aaah I don't know. still not convinced. I trust no one in this world more than my gut instinct, but still think it's important to gather as much data as possible first, then do what feels right\\nFriend: oh god no. I'm not getting involved in diy closing of any leaks ever again\\nPersona: I was thinking about the \"if there's no one who matches my excitement about sth\" thing a bit. I actually may be dependent on this one aswell, and I think I end up trying to force it upon people. Perhaps I even showed you my weird AI pong experiment haha. I usually spam my best friend, who knows a bit of nerdy stuff, I don't know how sustainable is that cause I might be ultra annoying but he does not tell me.\\nPersona: Now I think that maybe I stopped that AI pong because I ran out of unique impressions from other people xd\\nPersona: this I totally get. It might be paradigm in the world about coding, data science and nerdy things. I really god damn want to find all the needed evidence to break this belief, but I am not getting close to this\\nPersona: at the company I work we have engineering team and sales team. The sales people are extreme extroverts. I could not believe people can be so extroverted, it came as a shock to me. They just never stop interacting. The engineers only talk to each other. Most of them never show up to friday bars and the one guy that does, he is like the cool engineer dude, I can still see that he is lonely sometimes in parties. I am in a position between both of them. And this position is so weird. So this might be an ultimate dilemma whether to pursue nerdy things or not\\nPersona: I just came back from my company retreat which held us in Sweden for a few days (and thus sorry for responding late, it was very intense) and I kept thinking about being inward and outward at the same time. I spent my holiday very inward and I am semi-inward at work and then tried to be outward but I can't just switch instantly and I had a bad experience.\\nPersona: Wonder if you thats also how you felt\\nPersona: I haven't tried to convince you yet. I am not sure if I should haha, I haven't tested it yet.\\nPersona: But basically, gathering as much data as possible before taking action is very costly and I would say you still can't eliminate all risk.\\nPersona: And sometimes taking a bit of action, even if its a wrong one, can reveal so much more and get you deeper knowledge faster than research.\\nPersona: Of course if one is making million dollar decisions, then each extra knowledge might be worth it. Thats why I say learning to use gut feeling is more relevant for startup founders. And speed, non-bureaucracy, little administrative burden is a big advantage of startups.\\nPersona: Another kind of related thing is that (generally) the more failed startups one experiences, the higher the chance that the next will be better. So perhaps it's better to fail two startups in three years and learn so much for the third one, than spend multiple years looking for a perfect idea with no real-world experience.\\nFriend: AI ping pong. I actually do have a memory of looking at it, but don't remember what was that all about...what was that all about?\\nFriend: and he hasn't unfriended you yet. you must be doing something right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc4f\\nFriend: you know, I think it may seem  it's a STEM people thing due to introverts being overrepresented in that group. I definitely do see people from other walks of life experience this as well\\nFriend: oh man, sales people are intense. cool when you want a fun night out, but I feel they talk at you and not to you most of the time. engineers are computer science and math/physics people - I have a special bond with those. may know them for 10 min, but it always feels like we've been friends for 10 years\\nFriend: the thing about being in-between - I get it. personally, I do have to go to different people for different things a lot, because I've never really been able to get all my social needs met by one friend group. love talking to nerds, but you can't really drag them downtown to a rave. love party people, but I don't know how to connect with them on a deeper level. sciencey people are awesome when I've just learnt about some cool study I want to discuss, but I'm not nearly as logical and grounded as them. once I started volunteering at cultural events here in cph, I've realized how much I missed the freedom and creativity of artsy people. and so on. I don't know if I belong everywhere or nowhere, but I guess it is what it is\\nFriend: but in your case it could be an asset. I guess if you want to be in charge of sth larger, you need to be able to communicate with all sorts of people\\nFriend: hahah, yes. it feels like I'm in some sort of a locked in syndrome. my brain is happy to finally encounter some people, but cannot remember for shit how a conversation works\\nFriend: the only successful form of treatment it to lie down on the floor with a beer and pitbull in the background. can't believe it's not socially acceptable at workplaces yet\\nFriend: I've just realized that we have different types of choices in mind. I was thinking more generally, and you're referring specifically to business decisions. when I make big decisions, they usually concern the important turns in the trajectory of my own life, so my most precious resource is time. cannot really afford to lose too much of that. but when it comes to money and other renewable things, yeah, I think it's easier to just fuck around and learn from experience (I know you still invest and lose time here, but I guess it's not the main concern)\\nPersona: ahahah I litetally laughed \"with a beer and pitbull in the background\". What a mix\\nPersona: Need to try the full treatment\\nPersona: we should hang out sometime\\nPersona: wait I will reply later, gtg a bit\\nPersona: I used an evolutionary algorhythm to train a neural network to play computer ping pong. It was not bad. I could still beat it sometimes and I wanted to optimize it further but I didnt manage to train it to think a few seconds ahead\\nPersona: If I could give it some more time, i am sure I would\\nPersona: then they are doing smth wrong.  if they are socially akward, then atleast they should make it worth being\\nPersona: talk at you - smart way you said it. I dont know if I feel the same, for be its like animal making sounds - they just play their default sound all the time which is talking. At once I actually felt the same, idk how, but social interactions at work became sort of automatic to me. I would go to the coffee machine and I would not even realize that I am talking, and I would come up with such genius nice interactions without even having to think. And it made other people feel good. Then after, when leaving, I would wonder \"how the hell did I make this conversation\"\\nPersona: but then lately its no longer automatic like that \ud83d\ude02 I would go to the kitchen meet a neighbor cooking and then I would have to either do a painful small talk and think how to not seem it look like a small talk, or endure 10 minutes of tense silence.\\nPersona: and the problem with not talking is thay it is embarassing for me\\nPersona: for example, if its a school break - I have to talk. If I just stand here and dont talk - I am a lower tier individual.\\nPersona: lets skip this topic for now, I dont want to convince you of anything, I probably cant anyways. I just know thats this is the way for me personally now\\nPersona: btw, what fun did you have awake at 3AM before Monday morning \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: ah okay. yup, it rings a bell\\nFriend: what do you mean?\\nFriend: hahah this does sound exactly like the inner monologue I would expect a sales person to have\\nPersona: When one makes it big in life through STEM with the trade-off of being socially akward, then atleast it was worth it. If one is just socially akward without making it big, then why? Would better be social and enjoy the life seen in movies.\\nPersona: I would low-key like to be like the technical co-founder billionaires, who got a lot of money being nerdy and now they are super rich but awkward. Yet, when you have big money to spend you have a social life in easy mode.\\nPersona: I gotta tell you its a nice feeling. But I remember even when I had this mysterious abilitiy, it ceased to activate when work time ended. So for example when its 17 o' clock and the friday bar opens, I no longer have automatic conversations. Perhaps because I feel the pressure to do it.\\nFriend: waittt, let me finish responding to the previous one\\nFriend: is that so? in hindsight, with people from mine we were quite good at sensing whether the other person wants to talk and adjust accordingly. I think that was nice. tough it probably would be awkward not to talk in a shared flat for example\\nPersona: okay\\nPersona: no worries haha\\nFriend: idk if it's field dependent but during mine studies (both) it was totally normal that half would be socializing and half would just do their own thing - working, eating, texting, sleeping, whatever\\nFriend: nothing. my brain just never developed the ability to guess when the day starts during Danish winter and summer lol. it's completely random\\nFriend: you know, being socially awkward is not exactly a choice \ud83d\ude05"

I could be sipping non alcoholic pina colada or cola maybe\\nPersona: so you only talk to me as a manager? \ud83d\ude22 Should I start looking for a luxury rooftop hot tub and start crying about my loneliness already?\\nPersona: Sometimes I forget you are polish\\nPersona: you seem to cocealing your inner polish quite well\\nPersona: to be*\\nPersona: I tried this btw. I think it might be working\\nFriend: full 3 min version? because this is gold, you're missing out otherwise \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: oof, no, this is tricky socially. I don't know if there's a way out of this other than somewhat concerned 'oh okay'\\nFriend: or deflect with a question\\nFriend: I mean, as much as neurodivergence is celebrated these days, I'm sure every parents wants nothing more than for their kid to be healthy and have a life as easy as possible which is not exactly the case here\\nFriend: it is. it's referred to as hell planet for a reason. that's not the right vibe\\nFriend: milk! like a psychopath\\nFriend: yeah no, you just don't know me very well haha\\nFriend: I'm proud :')\\nFriend: oh look. now you can cry whenever and wherever you want!\\nPersona: Shampoo, bathtub and a sponge. Thats a whole depression cure kit \ud83d\ude31\\nFriend: but no Pitbull :/\\nPersona: How flat do you need to be on the ground for your famous depression repelling ritual, and is pivko neccessary?\\nPersona: I am afraid lack of Pitbull might not be the only issue here\\nPersona: I think so, I will see again\\nPersona: ok I didnt before xddd\\nPersona: but now I did xd\\nPersona: I cant believe this is real autism. It cant be that bad come on\\nPersona: With some spacer level advanced life support a hell environment would be THE vibe. You there crying in your nanotech-anti-gravity-force-field suit, while an apocalypse is raging outside. A perfect contrast, or perhaps a perfect reflection\\nPersona: I need to do this sometime as a social experiment\\nPersona: during a night out, pull out some a milk bottle, pour it in the glass, drink it and say no word\\nPersona: (without polish hazelnut vodka)\\nPersona: I must meet a polish Joanna\\nPersona: Had one of those autmatical social days at work today\\nPersona: automatic*\\nPersona: hows your job opportinity looking?\\nFriend: very flat. your exterior must look as dead as your interior feels\\nFriend: um for some time last year I had a temporary hobby of trying to establish how to measure perfect drink proportions with a very small plant pot (for the record - brand new, never used for its intended purpose lol), because I was trying to prove to my friends that it's possible. those were rum times, those dark times. I succeeded only once\\nFriend: thus for safety reasons piwko is recommended\\nFriend: I'm so amused haha. I have no idea what you thought it was\\nFriend: that sounds hot, but not in a good sense\\nFriend: I feel like in this day and age the ability to digest lactose is a rare flex, so you could gain some respect\\nFriend: dunno. will email them next week\\nPersona: So random, I will catch up on the rest of convo later (I got 2%)\\nPersona: then you would be in danger of curing depression by drowing. I sense something sus here\\nPersona: \"for safety reasons piwko is recomended\" I have the impression many polish people apply this as mantra to many situations\\nPersona: I think jokes floating around in my lithuanian friend group distorted my understanding of autistic\\nPersona: oh yeah, I flex everytime. When I am making coffee at work and choose between all the inclusive selection of milks, I must not take the lactose free one. I want my lactose. I always make sure I take one with lactose and I announce it verbally\\nPersona: I just noticed the message didnt sent and my phone died yesterday \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: I would not do this at 10 in the morning \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: atleast not so intensely animated\\nFriend: excellent choice \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\\nFriend: oh no, bathtub is your idea. that's a you problem \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: my only battle is trying not to choke on beer\\nFriend: speaking of Poland. I think your Pole magnet properties are at work again, because looks like a Polish lad is moving into my old room \ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: at least I'm glad that all the new equipment I paid for is going to serve my nation\\nFriend: oh yeah, fair enough. everyone uses this term very deliberately\\nFriend: same with gaslightimg and narcissim. which drives me crazy\\nFriend: yes, must maintain intense eye contact with coworkers while doing so\\nPersona: oh wait, when you said the recipe for your recipe I never realized this challenge. You must look deadly funny drinking piwko lying flat on the ground. A true piwko akrobat\\nPersona: recipe for your ritual*\\nPersona: my best polish friend is leaving denmark for a long while or maybe forever today. The universe sends me a replacement. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be\\nPersona: what is the correct meaning of narcissism then?\\nPersona: and how do people use it wrong?\\nPersona: force them to submission. milk tolerance dominance. everytime\\nFriend: this is an extreme sport. when I was little my mum always told me not to drink while lying down bc apparently there is a story of a girl who did that once, choked and went into coma\\nFriend: I'm so mad. I was waiting 2 years for fsb to give me my own polish person in the kitchen \ud83d\ude20\\nFriend: idk people just tend to diagnose every person who wronged them with a mental illness\\nPersona: my finding at 2 am today\\nPersona: unrelated to anything\\nPersona: (the video is the same, it just showed that it couldn't send, so I sent it again)\\nPersona: (or rather the video is so good I had to send it twice)\\nPersona: well its also very unfortable. I guess its comparable to nailing nails with your elbow, like u can do it and it might ever work, but why ever in the first place. And there is probably risks with that too\\nPersona: they well pranked you there"

Did it just happen due to pure random entropy or you did smth?\\nPersona: Need any help or moral support?\\nFriend: lol what? he made it seem like you're drowning there\\nFriend: noo, it's good he was. it was really serious. I got woken up by a stream of water under pressure hitting that whole panel over kitchen niche. and I mean water hose kind of stream. I was trying to stop it, but it was so intense and everywhere that I couldn't even breathe. thank fuck it was 7:20 so I ran there in my pajamas without shoes just banging in the door and yelling at them to turn of the water\\nFriend: and by the time we got back the whole room was covered in like 1 cm layer of water\\nFriend: also electricity was off\\nFriend: they called some people with the machine to dry that water off, and since it started to pour down into yours they had to tear off the whole floor to dry the beton underneath\\nFriend: the best thing - I'm having my move out inspection literally tomorrow\\nPersona: crazy story, I imagined you running in pyjamas to the office \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: will you be charged for that?\\nFriend: yup, going out of my pocket. apparently you're supposed to have your own insurance for things like that here in Denmark\\nFriend: so that's the life tip from today\\nPersona: ohhhh, how much?\\nPersona: btw how r you doing? What are your plans ahead?\\nFriend: according to current estimates I'll have to pay around 7 or 8k above the deposit\\nFriend: in terms of what?\\nPersona: that is insane\\nPersona: Its something hardly in your control.

I'm totally at fault\\nFriend: they're actually super sweet. didn't charge me anything for cleaning, and they were super helpful throughout\\nFriend: also how was the weekend with the big fan over your head? because I think my whole floor hates me at this point. it was so loud\\nFriend: I hope to. I hope I didn't go through all this shit to now move away \ud83d\ude05 there's one group I'd really love to work with, but they said they're trying to figure out funding for some new studies, and they'll know whether they can take me in mid Jan\\nFriend: so now I have to wait\\nFriend: I also have a plan B group, but the lady from that one also told me to contact her  after new year\\nFriend: tbh I don't know anything anymore. my life hasn't been going great as you can see lol\\nPersona: what in the world do you have to do to make that happen?

Cause unless a become a man of the countryside (which may be plausible if we get on with the idea of gettinf farm animals drunk), its not very useful\\nPersona: You are studying neuroscience, right?\\nPersona: holy shit I made so many typos\\nFriend: enlighten me then! maybe I'll need it one day, who knows\\nFriend: hmm good question. seems plausible that there is *some* limit, but it may be a surprisingly high one, considering existence of savants, for example\\nFriend: we have 86bln neurons, which provides equipment for absolutely insane number of connections\\nFriend: yes sir\\nFriend: haha no worries\\nPersona: wait I gotta look up some weird lithuanian terms in english then\\nPersona: okay, so there are four ways in which the soil can degrade 1) soil erosion, 2) soil salinization 3) shortening of the crop rotation and 4) grazing\\nPersona: and the types of erosion are 1) mechanical 2) wind 3) water\\nPersona: There you go, hope it serves you well\\nPersona: I think you must have been the right person to ask this question. I kinda did some neural network training so I can imagine 86bln. connections being able to learn a lot of. But probably it works to some extent differently\\nPersona: I once taught an AI to play pong game just to try reinforment learning. Then I tried to teach it to be aggressive in the game. But it still had like 20 connections total. I kinda want to get back this project\\nPersona: and what is your thesis about or you still havent crystalized your topic?\\nFriend: eh I can memorize this\\nFriend: but not that\\nFriend: perhaps I won't be the best farmer in the village, but I might have a chance of survival\\nFriend: oh no, I'm not an expert by any means. I had a computational neuroscience course and now I work around people who study connectivity, so I hear about it here and there, but that's about it\\nFriend: yeah people do really fun stuff with neural networks these days\\nFriend: I'm involved in research on differences in risk-taking behaviour and related brain activity in entrepreneurs vs managers\\nPersona: Brain is interesting, computer science is interesting. Computational neuroscience must be ultimately interesting."

But maybe it will get bette\\nPersona: I am not saying it has to be banned. It should be a choice. Cause we had exam out of it, so if you want a 10, its not a choice then\\nPersona: Nietche is fine for me personally, but I'll take the rant I have written and chose to omit from before about the hunger artist\\nPersona: The hunger artist is about a man, I think Kafka himself, who starved himself to death, because he had a disease that made it too painful to eat.\\nPersona: That may make me sound superficial, but since I read that book, I have grown so many fears. That pain could be such big physical pain that existing would be worse than non-existing. That fear is really not good for me. Everytime I get some weird unexplainable pain in for example joints, I am like \"faaak I will be The Not Moving Artist\" or if I get some random numbness I will be like \"The Paralyzed Artist\". That is making me too worried and scared of life.\\nPersona: Of course, it's a tradeoff, cause if that causes me to take fewer risks, I may overall ensure higher well-being and safety, but too much fear and risk-aversion can lead to the slowing of progress. And honestly I feel like I am not doing and risk-taking enough.\\nPersona: So I would have preferred to never know about it. I know that makes me sound terrible and superficial, cause I refuse to know about suffering and suffering is such a virtuous quality and yada yada\\nFriend: haha based on popularity of reddit book-based bots, thus may be a goldmine. I'd be surprised though if nobody has done anything similar yet\\nFriend: yeaaah, that one sounds rough and not really necessary. what was that supposed to teach you?\\nFriend: I sympathize, had read my fair share of graphic war-related stuff and medical stuff\\nFriend: actually, I'm impressed with literature you guys get at school, because our whole curriculum was Polish books about farmers. and war. and farmers going to war (to spice it up)\\nFriend: I still think that forcing people to read Nietzsche at school is a smart move, even for the reasons you stated. I think usually people reach for those works when they are down and alone, and therefore more susceptible to that philosophy, as it seems to confirm what they already believe. by deconstructing it in a class environment, you get inputs from people of opposing views, you are shown the weak points and so on\\nPersona: you lurk in Reddit? \ud83d\ude2e\\nPersona: I dont know actually. We never deeply discussed it, just got an intro and summary\\nPersona: ughh medical stuff. I cant take. I once was in blood testing lab for a school excursion and I didnt even see blood I almost fainted. But it was fine afterwards cause they gave me candy\\nPersona: Also its weird cause I can easily murder people in video games full of gore and dont care. I always get freaked out about my own blood.\\nPersona: Maybe its because I has internstional program. But we had some lithuanian literature. The iconis one is \"Kliud\u017eiau\" where a kid shoots a cat. Kliud\u017eiau means smth like \"got in to the way\"\\nPersona: But I mostlt liked international. I wrote a nice essay about Doolhouse\\nPersona: actually its a play by henrik ibsen\\nPersona: I agree that its nice if they show the weak points of those philosophies. Also, what do you think depressed people really do in modern times? Do they really resort to reading philosophical books?\\nFriend: oh lord, Reddit raised me. the damage has been done. and sealed. I just thank the gods I was too young to experience 4chan\\nFriend: so just to suffer. I think there are some horrifying things previous generations had to read and now they get a bit of schadenfreude from watching kids go through the same torture\\nFriend: of maybe that's a Polish thing\\nFriend: because we have at least one of those\\nFriend: there's this classic from 17th century I had to read when I was 12. and there (spoiler!) a bad guy gets impaled (?) or whatever the English term for that is\\nFriend: my parents were very amused while watching me getting traumatized\\nFriend: oooo I have questions!\\nFriend: I never meet people like that, because everyone in the medical field is so desensitized\\nFriend: okay games, but what about movies?\\nFriend: or documentaries?\\nFriend: and is it different when it's somebody else's blood compared to yours?\\nFriend: and does it have to be actively drawn or if it's just chilling somewhere it's also bad?\\nFriend: for sociopathic fun or...?\\nFriend: the title sounds familiar, but idk if it's because it's uncharacteristic or I've actually heard it. was there some big film based on it?\\nFriend: I think few people read the whole book, most likely they just come across some catchphrases taken out of context, which is even worse\\nPersona: impossibl. I thought hot girls like you don't use reddit\\nPersona: But I am a redditor too, although I deleted the app recently cause I started spending to much time scrolling in silly subs\\nPersona: I have recently revised the museum of reddit subreddit, so got back into it a bit\\nPersona: holy shit this word, we were all fascinated about it in English class I remember, it was the main troll joke of our English class for a year. Even teacher was on it.\\nPersona: but eh I don't think so that was the case in my class. Our literature teacher was the best mix of everything. I enjoyed doing analysis in her classes so much.\\nPersona: Damn they make you read this and then say video games cause violence. Unacceptable\\nPersona: Yes. Bingo\\nPersona: To this ^\\nPersona: And bingo number two kinda\\nPersona: You asked the right questions\\nPersona: Basically I only feel uncomfortable when my blood is involved in the situation. But this is also a bit complex. I would not mind seeing my blood like chilling somewhere, so a finger cut that I quickly cover does not bother me at all. So to be prescise, its the fact of knowing that I have less blood now that bothers me. As soon as I think some blood is drawn from me I start to feel shivers (even now as I am typing).\\nPersona: It would be probably really funny if you saw me getting a blood test. I always make sure I make good friends with the nurse so she gives me great treatment. Then I exaggerate how I don't like the sight of my blood and I never look to the blood that was drawn from me.\\nPersona: Once I haad a terrible experience. The nurse failed to take my blood like three times, the vein 'didn't work' or smth, no blood was coming. You can imagine how I felt.\\nPersona: But the blood tests are not really a big issue, not even an issue. The worst part is that I can never get myself to donate blood. My friends do it regularly and I always skip, cause I would not be able to live with the fact that I have less blood, even if it's temporary. In my mind I am like imagining air gaps in the blood vessels, as there is not enough blood to fill whole volume.\\nPersona: I don't even remember the plot. All I can remember that this kid killed the cat and the word 'Kliud\u017eiau\" was kind of ironic and it became a joke around lithuanian students.\\nPersona: about that ^\\nPersona: Yeah. I watched the film called \"The Turin Horse\"\\nPersona: It was once of kind film\\nPersona: It was basically an moving picture of meaninglessnes\\nPersona: This review summarizes the film really well\\nPersona: And it was related to what a horse that Nietzsche saw being beaten.\\nPersona: damn I need to watch this film again\\nFriend: suuuure. careful there or you'll drop your fedora!\\nFriend: omg I know! it's ridiculously addictive\\nFriend: oh no, once you give in to check that one little thing, it's over\\nFriend: it's so useful. idk how the rest of languages managed without it. actually I love all those strange words from different languages describing very very specific phenomena. I don't think we have anything like that\\nFriend: only now it's occurred to me how concerning it is that this dude just casually knew a step-by-step instructions to impalement. bit of a weird flex\\nFriend: although he later got a Nobel prize, so perhaps that's the way\\nFriend: woah what?! that's soo cool. I thought it's just purely sensory, but it looks like there's a pretty complex cognitive process underneath. have you always felt that way?\\nFriend: that's totally understandable. that is a lot of blood\\nFriend: oooh that one. yeah it's been in my periphery for a long time, but I've always been sort of afraid to watch it\\nFriend: for the same reason I've never seen Space Odyssey or The Holy Mountain\\nFriend: because I don't know if I'm able to form an opinion independent of their acclaim. if I like it, is it because of conformism? if I don't, is it because I didn't understand?\\nFriend: I wonder when it's lost those two stars\\nFriend: okay, I suppose this is the end of this conversation\\nFriend: I'm sorry if I unknowingly did something that caused this. regardless, I really enjoyed talking to you and wish you all the best:)\\nFriend: well, inevitably - see you around\\nPersona: no wait"

But who knows\\nPersona: I may have done one weird thing actually\\nPersona: you may.have even heard it xdd\\nPersona: I had a friend over and it was late, I dont remember if we were drunk, but I started ranting on how hard it is to cut carrot, so I we tried slicing them katana style and I think the noise was a bit too loud and scary. Cause the next morning I saw two neighbours asking what the hell was that\\nPersona: I apoligized for cutting my carrots in a wrong way though xd\\nFriend: I don't think so. you know, you can hear when there are multiple people inside a room, and also now I recall from that party that he doesn't drink\\nFriend: no, jokes aside, I think that poor guy may just have some health issues, mental or not, and he denied it, because he was embarrassed\\nFriend: hahaha what? how loud can you cut a carrot? were you cutting it with a chainsaw or sth\\nFriend: you know, once at an afterbar afterparty we had a cabbage cutting competition. needless to say, fingers were cut open. you'd love it\\nPersona: fair enough, could be\\nPersona: Damn, I feel bad for the cabbages tgat were murdered\\nFriend: I think that was the most detailed mental visualization of potatoes I've done in my life\\nFriend: but that's why I first cut the carrot in half along the main axis, and slice it after. knife gets a better grip. the drawback is that you're forced to lead a sad life with semicircles instead of circles of carrot, so there's that\\nPersona: wait did I say potatoes\\nPersona: oh fuck I did\\nPersona: I meant carrots\\nPersona: I think I explained it poorly, cause my problem is exatcly cutting in on the main axis\\nPersona: like the knife slips\\nFriend: oh I thought it was intentional haha - to first really flesh out the idea of the extent of circularity we're dealing with here, and then move onto the actual target\\nFriend: wait, are we talking about the same thing?\\nFriend: look\\nFriend: original\\nFriend: step one\\nFriend: step two\\nPersona: If I said smth that barely makes sense, I probably made a typo. I am infamous for my typos. Please dont assume, or you'll end up like in one of those 'instructions not clear ...' memes haha\\nPersona: my problem is step one \ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\\nPersona: wait, I'll illustrate in a bit\\nPersona: if the blue arrow is where I want to cut, then the red one is where the trajectory ends up being\\nFriend: shh it was just an unintentionally poetic description. let it be\\nFriend: oh stand the carrot up on the cutting board, so that the wider end touches the board, and thinner end points towards the ceiling. cut from the very tip down to the other end. voila\\nFriend: just to make it even, it's better not to place it like this: 0, rather turn it by 90 degrees\\nPersona: OKAY. This actually might work\\nPersona: I'll try it\\nPersona: But I dont get this part\\nPersona: 0 is like standing?\\nPersona: but if its 90 deg. then its lying again\\nPersona: How much crazy good pool shots do I owe you for that?\\nFriend: might work?! have some faith in me. this a technique supported by over a decade of experience\\nFriend: trust me, you could cut carrots like that even if you were a character in 'a quiet place'\\nFriend: yeah, I felt it wasn't a clear explantation. don't worry about it too much, unless you're very pedantic, but - ideally cross-section of a carrot would be a circle and you would cut through its diameter, right? but irl it's probably more of an ellipse or at least it's uneven. through trial and error I've learnt that's it's better to cut through the shortest possible diameter, so that you have more volume on the sides of the knife\\nFriend: I'll let you decide. once you try it, tell me how much you think it's worth\\nPersona: I really need to learn this technique. Might be useful if we end up in a world like this after out time travel masterplan\\nPersona: I think you discovered a level above rocked science in terms of difficulty - carrot science.\\nPersona: I want carrot sticks, so I never do the step 3\\nPersona: step2*\\nPersona: I think you are rather explaining about cutting them in circles (elipses)\\nPersona: you better take an advance payment, cause there is a risk that as a begginner I stab myself with this new technique\\nFriend: I hope I can add PhD in Carrot Science to my resume\\nFriend: nonono, it's all about step 1. I think you will figure it out yourself, because it's pretty intuitive. if not, I'll just show you one day\\nFriend: I'm flexible. I'll accept payment in blood as well. just try not to cut your finger off, or we'll be in trouble\\nFriend: now that I think about it, maybe pool doesn't require all fingers - feel free to cut some off, just choose carefully\\nPersona: Hope I can get my hands on some carrots in Wales, otherwise I'll do it in my Tingbjerg carrot lab\\nPersona: You are free to come and collect my blood if I end myself trying to cut a carrot.\\nPersona: I think two on the left hand is enough. I guess then there is no use for the rest in life.\\nPersona: I might leave the middle finger just for fun though\\nFriend: ugh how inconvenient. I'll charge you extra for that\\nFriend: I suppose counting on fingers will become slightly tedious, but perhaps you can get by\\nFriend: just don't forget to put the rest in the freezer. they're probably not particularly valuable, but you can always find some madlad in need of an eccentric lucky charm\\nPersona: You can collect my heart too then. But please make good use of my organs.\\nPersona: We have a decimal number system for 10 fingers, so with eight fingers, I will have to use the octal system. Might take time to adapt\\nPersona: In the shared kitchen freezer, right?\\nFriend: I can sell them, sell them or sell them. what do you want me to invest in then?\\nFriend: the have clearly given us those huge freezers for a reason. it would be disrespectful to reject the offer\\nPersona: So if you had my heart, you would just sell it? \ud83d\ude1f\\nPersona: yeah, perfect for Tingbjerg finger cutting massacre\\nFriend: out of all possible uses of a resected heart I can think of, this one is the least creepy, so I'd take it if I were you \ud83d\udc40\\nFriend: oh so you're not stopping at your own fingers?\\nPersona: What if it's still beating in love? Would you still sell it?\\nPersona: Well if it's set up like that, probably the kollegium secretly implies that such finger removal campaign must be committed. Just following the hints\\nFriend: you're being difficult, you know \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: okay, you've won. the heart and I will live happily ever after"

Notion is really nice for project maagement and has a half amazing half decent table (database) functionality. But for personal wiki I prefer Logseq\\nFriend: Markdown is ez pz\n\nThe usefulness comes from the extensions and those are a bit intimidating\\nPersona: ah okay, I didn't try much extensions\\nPersona: I didn't like obsidian because it has stupid functionality for block references. Its more page based.\\nPersona: And it also has much more primitived block embed functinality (make a editable reference to a block). You edit in point A, it changes in Point B and vice versa. On Logseq this is possible, fully native, and easy.\\nPersona: Thats the feature I was dreaming about in MindManager for so long\\nPersona: I don't like page based, because a big task in note-taking is deciding where to put what and then deciding where to look for what. If you also need to think about pages, then its an extra variable in your decision making process.\\nPersona: Logseq automates that, so any single block can be a page, you just press on it to zoom in and it becomes the root element\\nPersona: But they also have pages (which is sometimes till needed so files don't get too large and if you want to collaborate, so you can work in diff files, like in coding)\\nPersona: The only issue with Logseq is that its less stable and feels a little weirder and less polished than Obsidian. Obsidian is super smooth\\nPersona: Next semester I will try switching uni notes to Logseq, but I am a little anxious. There will be many improvements with that - like I can't wait till I can use block embeds, also I will be able to share my notes with other people in a standardized format. Search functionality is better too.\\nPersona: But I am anxious that the mindmap layout presentation will turn out to be much more superior to bullet list presentation when it comes to complex topics I will study. Also in Logseq there is less options for content visual customization, so making things standout is more limited (bolding, colors still work).\\nPersona: bruuug sweet\\nPersona: you look good\\nFriend: Thanks man\nWas a good time\\nFriend: I'm happy she wants to show me\\nFriend: Was thinking some days before that ppl post on diff social media diff side of them and was wondering if she will just want her own photos on instagram\\nFriend: Or would she show me\\nFriend: Cause ive heard a lot instagram is more for dating kind of\\nFriend: What are block embeds\\nFriend: Yeah.. i want some way to combine mindmanager mindmaps with note app\\nPersona: ig is general purpose social media\\nPersona: i dont think it has much specialization like linkedin which is for professionals\\nPersona: almost everykind of businness has ig profile these days\\nPersona: I think instsgram is good for dating, but its the same as saying 'a car is good for dating'. Ita good but its not made for it specifically\\nPersona: You edit in point A, it changes in Point B and vice versa. \n\nobj_A = Object()\n\nobj_A.var1 = \"hello\"\nobj_A2 = obj_A\nobj_A2.var1 = \"world\"\nprint(obj_A.var1) // \"world\"\\nPersona: thats prob best way to explain it\\nPersona: its like a mirror reference thats editable\\nPersona: mindmanager is so bad for integrations\\nFriend: They have that?\n\nWhere does the real obj live\nIs one original and other are references\\nFriend: Huh\nYoutube-like?\\nFriend: But with photos\\nPersona: I will show you later\\nPersona: bro do you really have no idea how instragram is used?\\nPersona: Its not like youtube in many ways. Its just very general. Less general than facebook, but fb has just became too general for the new times\\nPersona: you post updates about what you do, about your interests, show off some aesthetic you capture, show off the imagine of yourself you are creating, show your hobbies maybe, show your personality in reel, photos, stories\\nPersona: I mostly use it to see what my friends, aquantainces are up to. Maybe get inspired. I also use it to build a digital.image of myself, to already be able to show some of who I am without needing to meet someone, so I try to look nice, cool, happy (fot girls and for overall status). Then I use it for entertainment regarding reels. And for chatting with anyone. I also follow some business accounts\\nPersona: my fav part is the stories. Its a wonderful conversation starter\\nPersona: like I see soneone do smth then if I meet them or on story reply I inquire\\nPersona: I think you shluld use it more if you want more social\\nPersona: realllly good\\nFriend: Ooh\nI've seen this one\n\nAnnoying to work with business people that don't try to understand how to communicate\\nFriend: I am reading a book about UX designers communicating but i think it might be handy for any profession\\nFriend: I can do a summary when i read it\\nFriend: Maybe I can start by just observing what you and people put there? \nMight need some guidance when i start posting \ud83e\udde0\\nPersona: this chick is in game development"

I appreciate the glass of water\\nPersona: I called him on Saturday. tldr, he is interpreting this as his beef with Gustav, he says that Gustav just didnt like him and was jealous.

I also realized today that he was at tour de kitchen last year as well, and he was behaving so completely different then. idk what the hell happened to him. are you sure that he was just drunk and not on any drugs?\\nFriend: no worries! happens to the best of us\\nFriend: on Saturday? are you referring to that talk you had while I was still sitting with you\\nFriend: you know, to be honest, I don't know if apologies are worth that much if he still doesn't understand the gravity of this whole situation\\nFriend: noo, I totally get it. I was also shocked when I read it. I had no idea it's this bad\\nPersona: I pretty sure he was not on drugs. He doesnt do drugs afaik, I even offered him to do weed, he always refused\\nPersona: Maybe its because his wife wasnt around and she is usually around at parties with him\\nPersona: btw sorry I was on a hurry busy today since I woke up\\nPersona: I called him in the morning (by definition afternoon)\\nPersona: so sober talk\\nPersona: He might have not realised the situation, since he said sorry to you, but told me to not say sorry to Gustav \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: in the post it says he chased people with \"homemade flamethower\". Its not technically incorrect, but holy molly, if I read that without knowing the actual case, I would be terrified of tingbjerg for real xdd\\nFriend: yeah, I was wondering where tf did y'all get a flamethrower from. what on the scale from candle lighter to Elon Musk's flamethrower are we speaking of here?\\nFriend: well, one thing is sure.

I interview some people who had terrible finances and those interviews were really valuable, and I also interviewed people who had surprisingly optimized finances and those gave me interesting ideas too.\\nPersona: idk, its barely noticable. Its gone now\\nPersona: the wind is so crazy\\nFriend: shit, I just sort of accidentally walked 7km home from the hospital\\nFriend: I started walking bc I knew I couldn't bike, and wanted to see if it improves or I need to take the bus\\nFriend: but then got lost in thought and walked so far that it made more sense to just power through the rest\\nFriend: my review of this experience is that it's all fun and games until you start getting slapped in the face with rocks\\nFriend: you know who was biking though?\\nFriend: CARGO BIKE MUMS\\nFriend: alright then. I'm glad there's a range\\nPersona: ugh reminds me of the sand storm at the beach you told me about\\nPersona: but I haven;t stepped foot outside today\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: so just tell me whenever you can I am home today and tommorow unltil also evening\\nPersona: I am ready anytime\\nFriend: ok.

I'll be back in 10 min or so\\nPersona: okay, let me know when\\nFriend: now is fine?\\nPersona: ye I am.in kitchen\\nPersona: Lets go out this next week for ramen or pho\\nPersona: a perfect evening break in the middle of a busy week\\nPersona: I know a few good restourants that have vegan options\\nPersona: could not wait any longer without texting you \ud83d\ude44\\nFriend: sounds cool, but as I said - right now is not the best time\\nFriend: I'll let you know when I get my shit together, and if you're still up for it then, we can go\\nPersona: oki doki, until later then\\nPersona: sheeeet Denis really fucked and brought bad reputation to this dorm\\nPersona: I feel a bit of guilty too for not cutting him off before things escalated\\nFriend: yea I've seen\\nFriend: don't kill yourself over that. tbf judging by how unhinged he was, I don't think he would've listened to you or anyone else for that matter\\nFriend: though it is sth to learn from for the future\\nFriend: how you talked to him today?\\nFriend: have*\\nPersona: I think I might have been too optimistic that I can convince him to start behaving properly while he was so drunk. I was also too biased to denis side of story cause I know him and idk how, but in my mind he was mature and I could never assumed he would act so bad, especially given that he has a wife\\nPersona: and also I was above tipsy myself dealinf with this. I appreciate the glass of water\\nPersona: I called him on Saturday. tldr, he is interpreting this as his beef with Gustav, he says that Gustav just didnt like him and was jealous. I feel like he just does not want to look like he 'has lost to Gustav\", but I hope that he realizes that its not about that at all, and understood what he should never do\\nPersona: He said to say sorry to you, when I talked to him.\\nPersona: Anyways, its not for you to think about, I just wanted to exchange with someone about this thing who has some context\\nFriend: right? I also realized today that he was at tour de kitchen last year as well, and he was behaving so completely different then. idk what the hell happened to him. are you sure that he was just drunk and not on any drugs?\\nFriend: no worries! happens to the best of us\\nFriend: on Saturday? are you referring to that talk you had while I was still sitting with you\\nFriend: you know, to be honest, I don't know if apologies are worth that much if he still doesn't understand the gravity of this whole situation\\nFriend: noo, I totally get it. I was also shocked when I read it. I had no idea it's this bad\\nPersona: I pretty sure he was not on drugs. He doesnt do drugs afaik, I even offered him to do weed, he always refused\\nPersona: Maybe its because his wife wasnt around and she is usually around at parties with him\\nPersona: btw sorry I was on a hurry busy today since I woke up\\nPersona: I called him in the morning (by definition afternoon)\\nPersona: so sober talk\\nPersona: He might have not realised the situation, since he said sorry to you, but told me to not say sorry to Gustav \ud83d\ude2c\\nPersona: in the post it says he chased people with \"homemade flamethower\". Its not technically incorrect, but holy molly, if I read that without knowing the actual case, I would be terrified of tingbjerg for real xdd\\nFriend: yeah, I was wondering where tf did y'all get a flamethrower from. what on the scale from candle lighter to Elon Musk's flamethrower are we speaking of here?\\nFriend: well, one thing is sure. Denis has just accidentally earned himself a status of a legend of this dorm\\nFriend: I don't think there has been an incident like that since the times of armed break ins\\nPersona: on that scale it would sit exatcly at level of my aunts can of white spray\\nPersona: which in some ways could causr more terror and destructive damage than Elon Musks version\\nFriend: oh\\nFriend: that's...creative\\nPersona: Random, but are you still living upstairs or moved out? \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Jesus christ, I forgot\\nFriend: are you okay? is it really bad at yours?\\nFriend: yes, it's me. my faucet burst fucking open at 7 in the morning\\nFriend: sorry, I didn't check with you earlier.

We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nPersona: Also\\nPersona: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nPersona: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nPersona: This could be huge\\nPersona: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nPersona: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nPersona: thats what I lvoe\\nPersona: love*\\nPersona: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe.

And also on MSPs?\\nPersona: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nPersona: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nPersona: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nPersona: cause if not we should get looking\\nPersona: perhaps\\nPersona: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nPersona: we showed we are serious and won him\\nFriend: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nFriend: true\\nPersona: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nPersona: Dude\\nPersona: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nPersona: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nFriend: sounds accurate\\nPersona: wait a sec\\nPersona: I'll show you some gold\\nPersona: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nPersona: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nFriend: U did it again!\\nFriend: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need"

Tried tuning it a bit, changing prompts, but what I got to does not feel like what I would do\\nPersona: Although the last one is not that bad\\nPersona: Give me some text tommorow that you had to read or smth, could be multiple pages and pdf also good, I will run it through so highlight/hide the text.\\nPersona: Dude makes fun tech stories\\nFriend: Yooo\nYou wrote a lot of ai stuff\nHaven't had time to see all\\nPersona: fuck it\\nPersona: if you have time :Dd\\nPersona: then read it, otherwise, can be skipped\\nFriend: Its interesting qhat you found\nCause i wanna try using lang chain to make ai docs\\nFriend: Lol nice\\nFriend: Always slipping\n\nIts like ice skating shoes but for asphalt\\nPersona: Xddd\\nPersona: The artsyles prompt ideas are pretty cool though. And combining them is nice\\nPersona: Good for making steam, forum avatars\\nPersona: What do you use for notetaking?\\nFriend: Notion is the shit imo\\nFriend: Used it during internship\\nFriend: Have a journal there\\nFriend: And anything that has a time i try to immediately put in the calendar so i can keep track of life\\nPersona: I been experimenting with notion for a while and idk, it does not stick to me\\nPersona: Whole day I was researching note taking apps\\nPersona: I feel it takes very long to make notes in Notion and having everything on many pages, things get lost and navigation takes time.\\nPersona: Also I like the toggleable bullet list approach that MindManager for example uses\\nPersona: Its hard for me to write in paragraph style\\nPersona: I am experimenting with Obsidian and Logseq\\nPersona: Obsidian is super cool, but its paragraph style\\nPersona: Loqseq is bullet point style\\nPersona: I watched note-taking, seconds brain apps for whole video and there was no mention of Mindmanager\\nPersona: I might be too uses to it now, its really hard to switch. I can immediately feel what I am missing once I try some other. The problem with Mindmanager is that is very closed and the company behind it seems super old-fashioned and it just not being developed better. Plug-in support seems to suck. They are also focusing on companies using that, but I think it kind of sucks in that area, I can't imagine managing a team, tasks and costs and stuff on MindManager. Notion is much better.\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: nice\\nPersona: i played in it.my kitxhen with the speaker on the other end of the kitchen and they thougt its real person\\nPersona: yo wtf\\nPersona: you can install app with chrome context menu\\nPersona: go here in chrome in android\\nPersona: click the three dots\\nPersona: and there is install app button\\nFriend: Yeah! \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude04\nI told you about web apps when i wanted to do the river thing\\nFriend: Acts a bit like a native app after install but its just a website\\nPersona: thats pretty cool\\nPersona: might be interesting if you are into housing market\\nPersona: and mortgages\\nPersona: Dude, you are probably the only person I can discuss this with\\nPersona: Recently, I've been doing a lot of networking and then also trying to purposely use network as a resource and also seen people use it and it worked wonders. At this point I became really interested in the topic itself, not necessarily how to find new people, but more like how to deepen connections to 'unlock new possibilities with each person' (if that makes sense). At this point of planning to make a system of how I take note of these things, ensure completeness and reflect on methods. And also coming up with conversational methods on how to deepen connections.\n\nThis is already slithly weird, but this get weirder. I read a book a while ago, that is still my faav book. \"How to win friends and influence people\" - the author shares some fundamental ways in dealing with people, making them like you (and thus new levels on possibilities) and leveraging them. I will use his methods to sort of get deeper connections. Its a little forced, but one of the fundamental things is that I should find something about people that interests me aswell, so its not so forced - makes it easier, more impactful and sincere-looking I think.\\nPersona: The fact that I am taking this so serious is sounds quite weird, but honestly, weird things worked out wonders for me in the past, so I will keep up with it.\\nFriend: very deliberate approach :D\\nFriend: I've seen you fishing people \n\nuse a bit of what they like and try to involve the things you like \nsee where is the match\\nPersona: Yeah, but then I need to aggregate stuff about them to a few universal things. Like \"What is their eager want?\"\\nPersona: this is from a book\\nPersona: And I rerely got to this, but I actually did\\nPersona: And things get interesting then\\nFriend: what would be an eager want for me?\\nFriend: I imagine it as things I want to really talk about\\nPersona: This one girl from America I met at Portugal, we spend a bunch of time one night and I understood that her deep need is to \"make her parents proud of her\" and it had some reasoning that made sense, as she wanted to give back etc.\\nPersona: you are the exception to this loop xdd I don't fill the table on you\\nPersona: but hmm\\nFriend: cause this sounds really deep\nthere is probably little to no way to get there through a conversation on a friday bar consistently\\nPersona: You like to be able to find new shortcuts/hacks to doing something and you like experimenting or 'building' things.\\nPersona: You also like to be honestly curious into things, cause that makes it easy for you to go deep. You don't seem to force yourself to fake like something, unless its really pushed by society.\\nPersona: Yeah we talked alone, at night, the setting was really for a deep convo\\nPersona: I came up with a list of questions actually\\nFriend: to help you get there?\\nPersona: yeah\\nPersona: But I am not using them too much, cause I forget\\nPersona: Need to fix that"
