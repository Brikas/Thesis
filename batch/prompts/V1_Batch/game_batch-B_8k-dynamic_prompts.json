But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website. And I think at \u201eMaigold\u201c there\u2019s a lot of classes and you can also pay in cash\nFriend: I see you are enjoying the monkeys\nPersona: Yeah They where sweet, except when they stole my moms sandwich\nFriend: Did you pet them?\nPersona: No actually not, my parents said it was a bad idea\nPersona: Any news about Bella sky or guldsmeden?\nFriend: I will need your cv\nPersona: I Will send it to u now\nFriend: I will send it to her. She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\nFriend: thats my email\nFriend: her answer is\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\nFriend: and the questions above\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\nFriend: and if you can be creative\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\nPersona: I did not get the job...\nFriend: Just to practice your French\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\nPersona: Still exited to watch\nFriend: I am in\nPersona: Nice job\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\nPersona: Home\nFriend: Coming\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\nPersona: Where r we meeting?\nFriend: Oh fuck.we had a meeting today??\nFriend: I literally forgot to put on my calendar\nFriend: where were we supposed to meet?\nFriend: when*\nPersona: No worries, I overslept 2\nPersona: Also I accidentally put it at 12 instead of 10, idk why\nPersona: Wanna move it 2 this afternoon, if u have time?\nFriend: Would it be a problem meeting on Thursday?\nPersona: That\u2019s cool\nPersona: 10 at sp?\nFriend: Okay, I make note!\nPersona: I\u2019ve updated the drive-folder I share with you\nPersona: Can I get access 2 this map?\nFriend: Its empty almost\nFriend: but yeah, send me your email\nPersona: Eliastorjani@gmail.com\nFriend: I shared with you\nFriend: Have you found if Aspiri thing can be shared?\nPersona: Unfortunately not.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nPersona: \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude22\nFriend: Elias\nFriend: how are you?\nFriend: \u2764\u2764\nPersona: I\u2019m good.

They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\nPersona: I'll look\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nFriend: He is platforms dude\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nFriend: from him?\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\nFriend: perhaps\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nPersona: true\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nPersona: sounds accurate\nFriend: wait a sec\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\nFriend: Hello! \ud83d\udc93 My German parents are still in town :) So I\u2019m kinda busy today.

Just lmk\nFriend: What about now? I think earlier fits better than later 4 me:)\nFriend: hey bror, are u still in albania? hope you only drank a decent amount of alcohol. \nFriend: Did Sam completely finish gymnasium btw?\nFriend: Have fun, don\u2019t drink tooooooo much and watch out for your jacket!\nFriend: Just getting drunk with the boys from the dormitory:)\nFriend: H\u00f6? How did this come up? Safe travels :)\nFriend: Albania this time\nFriend: Hahahah, on your way to Italy?\nFriend: Forgot\nFriend: Ouh, shit I also forciert\nFriend: sorry I\u2019m drunk in Frankfurt airport\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\nFriend: wait\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\nFriend: 5 days ago\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\nFriend: guidelines*\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\nFriend: Sounds good:)\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\nFriend: just woke uo\nPersona: Its lit\nPersona: Where r u sitting?\nFriend: In the back\nFriend: But on my way to Cantine rn\nPersona: What number is your study group?\nFriend: 21\nFriend: Where r u\nPersona: Generally, your paragraphs are too short. It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\nPersona: My feedback^\nPersona: My assignment lol^\nFriend: Thank u !!!\nPersona: Np\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\nPersona: Yes\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\nFriend: Sorry\nPersona: np\nFriend: Jacob called you.\nFriend: Where should we meet? I will be there in 15\nPersona: Im On my way!

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

I need to adjust my strategy haha\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above.

They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\nPersona: I'll look\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nFriend: He is platforms dude\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nFriend: from him?\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\nFriend: perhaps\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nPersona: true\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nPersona: sounds accurate\nFriend: wait a sec\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\nPersona: Pretty well.

I just arrived home safely:)\nFriend: Hey, have you used Notion?\nPersona: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I\u2019d be down 2 look into it next week. But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\nFriend: yeah same\nFriend: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\nPersona: Yeah, why?\nPersona: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\nPersona: Forgot it was exercise class\nFriend: umm\nFriend: Yeha if you are at cbs?\nPersona: I\u2019m nearby, at station\nPersona: I got until 14 if u want any help;)\nFriend: damb what are you doing?\nFriend: I still have a lecture\nFriend: Its ending now, but I have a study group meeting\nFriend: so idk maybe later, unless you want to join my study group meeting \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: 3d printing\nPersona: Which class?\nFriend: IMO\nFriend: at porcelehavensej\nPersona: I see.

The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\nFriend: Alright thanks\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\nPersona: Gotchu\nPersona: Still raining.

And also on MSPs?\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\nFriend: perhaps\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nPersona: true\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nPersona: sounds accurate\nFriend: wait a sec\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\nPersona: U did it again!\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\nPersona: I'm gonna focus on his literature.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\nPersona: My feedback^\nPersona: My assignment lol^\nFriend: Thank u !!!\nPersona: Np\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\nPersona: Yes\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\nFriend: Sorry\nPersona: np\nFriend: Jacob called you.\nFriend: Where should we meet?

But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nFriend: He is platforms dude\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nFriend: from him?\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them?

Keep the difference  in mind:\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\nFriend: oh okay\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\nFriend: like an 'alias'\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\nPersona: Just saw this now.

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

Why do you need me to make a repo?\nFriend: Apprently you can create a git repository in a Google Drive folder\nFriend: But\nFriend: since I like to learn stuff, I will find a workaround\nFriend: I will do the script later, I got a little bit annoyed while bulding it\nFriend: For now I will manually move items to it from time to time\nFriend: from him?\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\nFriend: perhaps\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nPersona: true\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nPersona: sounds accurate\nFriend: wait a sec\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\nPersona: U did it again!\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\nPersona: I'm gonna focus on his literature. But I'll wake up early instead (my sleep rhythm got me waking up 6 naturally\nFriend: alright\nFriend: 6 is a good time, true A person\nFriend: Btw\nFriend: but thats a decade ago\nFriend: nvm, unrelated what I have deleted\nFriend: I mapped and read through the headline of a lot of research in Software Ecosystems, mapped for you some papers in markdown, to perhaps skim headlines. sorted by citation count / recency /relevance\nFriend: Also jotted down some potential things to study there\nFriend: Havent read them, but just tried to gain some meta understanding\nFriend: they maybe unrelated tho\nFriend: Not feeling too good about this meeting in terms of what to suggest we reseach and how\nFriend: Maybe you can look how to pivot off this paper\nFriend: I havent really done that\nFriend: ughh why 8am ughh\nFriend: are you up.mate?\nFriend: Make me hungy and I'll find a way\nFriend: I am in\nFriend: I literally hacked your two factor auth xddd\nFriend: Their security system is so dumb\nFriend: without any hacking lol\nFriend: You'll laugh when I tell you about this\nFriend: Their security system is literally so flawed. After the exam I think I will message them asking for a bounty.\nPersona: 73393\nFriend: no need anymore bro\nPersona: Wtf hahahah\nPersona: How did u do this lmao\nPersona: Plz don\u2019t. Let\u2019s resell all of their content first hahahah\nFriend: I went to aspiri.dk logged in there, as they don't ask for 2factor, then changed the number for you account. Logged in at play.aspiri, got the code to my phone, then changed the number back to yours.\nPersona: This text is killing me!\nFriend: Well I'll ask for a comparable bounty xd\nFriend: Given that they have just lost 700 kr. becaue of us exploiting it, I would ask for a 10 000kr + bounty\nFriend: bounty hunting is a real and legit thing if you find exploits\nFriend: Companies pay for that\nPersona: Go get them!\ud83e\udee1\nFriend: Its a low chance this would work, but I could try after the exam\nPersona: I hope u get it\nFriend: Well if I get it, we split \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: but I'll go do econ now\nFriend: Hey, what is the calculator that you got?\nPersona: At sp school supplies they sell it\nFriend: How much you paid?\nPersona: about 350\nPersona: If u want, u can try my calculator before buying\nFriend: Hey, whats your mobile pay number?\nPersona: 24340011\nFriend: Alright\nFriend: aspiri dk is just next to cbs\nPersona: But we r inside already:p\nFriend: hoes econ going?\nPersona: I guess okay.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\nPersona: My feedback^\nPersona: My assignment lol^\nFriend: Thank u !!!\nPersona: Np\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\nPersona: Yes\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\nFriend: Sorry\nPersona: np\nFriend: Jacob called you.\nFriend: Where should we meet?

Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\nPersona: I'll look\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nFriend: He is platforms dude\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nFriend: from him?\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\nFriend: perhaps\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nPersona: true\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nPersona: sounds accurate\nFriend: wait a sec\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\nFriend: Free\nFriend: From 10.00 am\nPersona: No way\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\nFriend: Sure\nPersona: Hahahahah\nFriend: You can go Thursday\nFriend: With it\nPersona: Sounds crazy\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\nPersona: I'm so stoked\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\nFriend: No idea\nPersona: How is chile? Remember to use the go pro as much as possible\nFriend: On my way to the Easter island already\nPersona: Damn\nFriend: The wedding was crazy\nFriend: Found a girl as well\nPersona: Big surprise\nFriend: Hahahahaha\nFriend: Went to a restaurant called Denmark\nPersona: Looks fun^^\nPersona: Did they speak danish?\nFriend: Bro\nFriend: Why has nothing Danish\nFriend: There except the flag\nPersona: Lol, but why thogh\nPersona: Though*\nFriend: I don\u2019t know\nFriend: Hahaha\nFriend: Everything is messy here\nFriend: Chaos all over\nFriend: Loving it though\nPersona: I could imagine\nFriend: I\u2018m sorry\nFriend: Unfortunately it\u2019s in Phil\u2019s office backyard \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Can I borrow your bike?:)\nFriend: I don\u2019t really understand tbh\nFriend: But yeah, defining the loops is a good idea\nFriend: No, it was ridiculously unstructured as always\nFriend: Do you get feedback for papers? This way, you could at least have feedback for the next paper/re-exam :)\nFriend: I see, the analysis is always the hardest, I\u2019d say. \ud83d\ude0c but maybe you don\u2019t have to be so \u201econcrete\u201c? Maybe you can argue for whatever point you wanna make, with sources you already have?\nFriend: Hm, maybe you have to think of different steps and loops you have to take to finish an essay/paper. Did you work with a writing plan?\nFriend: I wish I could learn how 2 convert my time-mgmt mistakes 2 \u201crules\u201d 4 myself the next time, but it always seem 2 be completely new:(\nFriend: I do\nFriend: Already at the smoothie place tho. It\u2019s good!\nFriend: I\u2019d rather Hand in at the re-exam (it\u2019s the same assignment) than 2 hand in smth I\u2019m not proud of. The conclusion paragraph won\u2019t be hard, it\u2019s the analysis stuff that bugs me - 2 find citations from old academics on a future topic\nFriend: It\u2019s one of your first papers. I think, you don\u2019t have to be perfect. You can see it as a first trial, no? :) and in any case you learned a lot for the next time regarding time management and structuring stuff. :)\nFriend: Do you have grammarly or a similar Programm? I think, it would help to let it run through something like this? :) just to have some quick fixes \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Also if you want to safe some time, you can also just go to Caf\u00e9 Kraft to work from there. Therefore, you don\u2019t have to commute.\nFriend: Hi there \u2600\ufe0f \nFriend: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it:/\nFriend: 5.

And how is articial intelligence amplifying the effectiveness of persuation from foreing interference?\nFriend: Why is incentive misallignement in social media jeopardizing democracries? And how is articial intelligence amplifying persuation that is weaponized by foreing interference?\nFriend: rebecca.jaeger@icloud.com\nFriend: Gonna go home soon\nFriend: Yes\nFriend: Is it realistic 2 be within an hour?\nFriend: Just text me when u r ready:)\nFriend: And haven\u2019t got food yet \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\nFriend: We\u2019re still in the restaurant\nFriend: Ayayayayayay\nFriend: Yeah\nFriend: Do you have time like 20h?\nFriend: Just lmk when u r ready:)\nFriend: It was chill enough. Hopefully I\u2019ll meet him 4 real another time, because we didn\u2019t have time 2 talk that much\nFriend: Btw how was the night with ur guest?\nFriend: there's an asian take-away but portions little small. people are super nice though. seems like they dont have google maps. the name is 5 ace\nFriend: they have cheap and yummy lunch - i think we've been there. it's not take-away though\nFriend: never tried but got it recommended\nFriend: insanely good and fresh mexican food but the portions a little small\nFriend: they have insanely good smoothies and juices - i guess they also have some stuff which is healthy and to eat\nFriend: and veeeeery good\nFriend: this is vegtebale kebab - at least better than with meat \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: you could just take a pad-thai for take-away\nFriend: you've been here with us in summer\nFriend: bowls stuff\nFriend: very healthy + very good\nFriend: perfect!\nFriend: hahahhahaha, love it!\nFriend: Yes \ud83d\ude01\u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re all big\u2026 is it the denim-ish fabric ones that can\u2019t handle more that 30?\nFriend: Don\u2019t worry, I got the washing machine doing it\u2019s thing\nFriend: This crazy and takes long time. But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\nFriend: And then use the dryer\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\nFriend: For example Wednesday morning in maigold with a very edgy lady \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u263a\ufe0f\nFriend: There u can book through the website. And I think at \u201eMaigold\u201c there\u2019s a lot of classes and you can also pay in cash\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nPersona: U 2!\nFriend: What are you doing tonight\nPersona: Dying\nFriend: Like getting ducked up\nPersona: No\nPersona: I failed\nFriend: No you didn\u2019t\nPersona: Yes\nFriend: Then might as well drubk your pain away\nFriend: Drink\nPersona: I might reevaluate after dying 4 a few hours\nFriend: Fine\nPersona: Did u arrive at Alfred\u2019s?\nFriend: Yea\nFriend: Coke\nFriend: Come\nPersona: Bruh\nPersona: Im omw\nPersona: Christian missed your call.\nFriend: My call doesn\u2019t work\nFriend: What\u2019s up\nPersona: Thought I was lost but I hear music\nFriend: Hahahha\nFriend: Come I made a punch\nPersona: Longshot - but if any of your friends wanna earn some on a car laying in the garage through the summer, will u let me know?:)\nFriend: Ywah are you talking about in the us\nPersona: yes, + Mexico\nFriend: Your buying a car?\nPersona: No! It just seem less complicated 2 rent from a private person, when we r doing 2 different roadtrips\nPersona: Unless, it's cheaper than renting:P\nFriend: Ahh I get it now\nFriend: I will ask around when I get home\nPersona: Thx<3\nFriend: Definetly not cheaper\nPersona: I mean, I've seen cars 4 sale at about $2-3k, while renting is about $2k\nFriend: Yeah it\u2019s gonna be about that\nFriend: The problem with buying is then selling it\nPersona: We\u2019ll just give it away 2 u or smth I guess\nPersona: Or sell 2 a place taking the raw materials if u don\u2019t have space\nFriend: Ahh okay makes sense"

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nFriend: Did the new girl arrive??\nPersona: No she\u2019s coming tmr\nFriend: Ohh true\nFriend: I love this placee\nFriend: Go to the skapto para\nPersona: What is the slapto para? I googled it\nFriend: It's a restaurant\nFriend: The best burger place ever\nPersona: Okayyyyy!\nPersona: I guess I\u2019ll need 2 try it tomorrow\nFriend: Do itt\nFriend: They have the best vegetarian burger\nFriend: And lot of game\nPersona: I might get the veggie, just because I had a normal burger earlier today\nFriend: The new Georgian girl is in Plovdiv rn hahahah\nPersona: What game?\nPersona: What?\nFriend: Catan, Uno\nFriend: And etc\nPersona: Oh these kind of games, i see\nPersona: At a birthday party huh?\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Boo\nFriend: Just a party\nFriend: Hahaha\nPersona: It said happy birthday tho?\nFriend: When\nPersona: In your video when u filmed around\nFriend: Idk hahaha\nFriend: We are drunk\nFriend: I don\u2019t remember anymore\nPersona: Hahahaha\nPersona: We went 2 the burger place yesterday, and it was amazing!\nPersona: Also, we've met Fira and she is adorable\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Yayyyy\nFriend: Happy to hear thesee\nFriend: Enjoy baby\u2764\ufe0f\nFriend: Yass\nPersona: We r also watching Eurovision\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\nFriend: That was a fast no\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nFriend: uhm\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\nFriend: luck*\nFriend: Could be potential\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\nPersona: Nice!\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\nFriend: alright\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\nFriend: nice\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\nFriend: all the time\nFriend: this time the most\nFriend: out of all\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\nPersona: Will do now\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nPersona: I see\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nFriend: I confused the names\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it. If not, I will read smth else about our three topics.\nFriend: and l'll send those two emails in a bit\nPersona: Can u tell me online?\nPersona: Don't feel pressured 2 dive deep into MaaSim\nPersona: Finished rony's mail\nPersona: Gave input on Rob's\nFriend: Aaaaah so cute omg!!!!\nFriend: What happened???\nPersona: I blackouted and hit my head yesterday\nFriend: Oh Nikki\nFriend: Noooo * wtf ahahaha\nFriend: But is it serious?\nPersona: It\u2019s okay\nFriend: That\u2019s really nice\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\nFriend: Oh no\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\nFriend: Could be worse\nPersona: It's not that bad\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\nFriend: Love it\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\nFriend: Should I delete it\nFriend: Oh no\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\nFriend: My family follows me\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\nFriend: How are you doing?\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\nPersona: How r u?\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\nFriend: Im okay as well\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer.

It just seem less complicated 2 rent from a private person, when we r doing 2 different roadtrips\nPersona: Unless, it's cheaper than renting:P\nFriend: Ahh I get it now\nFriend: I will ask around when I get home\nPersona: Thx<3\nFriend: Definetly not cheaper\nPersona: I mean, I've seen cars 4 sale at about $2-3k, while renting is about $2k\nFriend: Yeah it\u2019s gonna be about that\nFriend: The problem with buying is then selling it\nPersona: We\u2019ll just give it away 2 u or smth I guess\nPersona: Or sell 2 a place taking the raw materials if u don\u2019t have space\nFriend: Ahh okay makes sense\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nPersona: I hope u get it\nFriend: Well if I get it, we split \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: but I'll go do econ now\nFriend: Hey, what is the calculator that you got?\nPersona: At sp school supplies they sell it\nFriend: How much you paid?\nPersona: about 350\nPersona: If u want, u can try my calculator before buying\nFriend: Hey, whats your mobile pay number?\nPersona: 24340011\nFriend: Alright\nFriend: aspiri dk is just next to cbs\nPersona: But we r inside already:p\nFriend: hoes econ going?\nPersona: I guess okay. I\u2019m not afraid not 2 pass\nFriend: okay nice\nPersona: Hbu?\nFriend: Idk, partly\nFriend: I feel chill, not stressed, cause I like learning econ, but I haven't learned enough.\nPersona: I got a whole as room!\nPersona: Come if u want\nPersona: sps04\nFriend: hmm maybe maybe\nFriend: coming\nFriend: Is it an auditorium?\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I passed the Econ exam today\nFriend: but I still want to do econ lol\nPersona: Congrats!\nPersona: Relax hhhaahaha\nPersona: Enjoy the weather\nFriend: Thank\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Most of your Anki cards are empty\nFriend: wtf\nFriend: weird\nFriend: what are you using to see them?\nPersona: The anki desktop app\nPersona: Idk, I have plenty of content 2 practice on, I\u2019ll manage\nFriend: weird...\nFriend: i'll come soon to uni\nPersona: git config --global alias.up 'pull origin main'\nPersona: Here is 2 alias scripts. Put them into your terminal. So u from now on only need 2 \"cd\" into your local version of the repo, and then write \"git cp\" to share yours, and \"git up\" to get mine;)\nFriend: well, a persona must be biast by definition I would assume\nFriend: if you are 0 biast, then you are just a general person, not really a persona\nFriend: Or what kind of bias did you mean?\nFriend: oh, I mean work in progres, I tend to use that a lot haha\nPersona: I see your points, but I meant of how \"we\" present the product to the personas. I think we'll learn a lot from talking 2 a focus group facilitator!\nPersona: I updated my repo. lmk if it works\nFriend: fuck I went to sp\nPersona: I forgot time and place. Is it worth coming if I can't be there before 14:30?\nFriend: i think its equally woorth as the other times\nFriend: another topic another lesson. same type of experience\nFriend: Honestly, this one is boring\nFriend: we are talking about obvious things\nPersona: I figured when doing the readings\nFriend: Hey mate, so see u tmmrow at DTU\nFriend: ?\nFriend: It starts 11:00\nPersona: Yes!\nPersona: How r u getting there?\nFriend: I am taking the car?\nFriend: but frederiksberg is not really on the way\nFriend: I can drive you back\nPersona: I\u2019ll txt u when I\u2019m there;)\nPersona: I\u2019m in the bus a bit late.

It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

And also on MSPs?\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\nFriend: perhaps\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nPersona: true\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nPersona: sounds accurate\nFriend: wait a sec\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\nPersona: U did it again!\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\nPersona: I'm gonna focus on his literature.

Logged in at play.aspiri, got the code to my phone, then changed the number back to yours.\nPersona: This text is killing me!\nFriend: Well I'll ask for a comparable bounty xd\nFriend: Given that they have just lost 700 kr. becaue of us exploiting it, I would ask for a 10 000kr + bounty\nFriend: bounty hunting is a real and legit thing if you find exploits\nFriend: Companies pay for that\nPersona: Go get them!\ud83e\udee1\nFriend: Its a low chance this would work, but I could try after the exam\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\nFriend: That was a fast no\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\nFriend: uhm\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically.

I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\nPersona: I did not get the job...\nFriend: Just to practice your French\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\nPersona: Still exited to watch\nFriend: I am in\nPersona: Nice job\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\nPersona: Home\nFriend: Coming\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\nFriend: No\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\nFriend: Saturday big game\nFriend: Final\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\nFriend: The whole office goes\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\nFriend: Sure\nFriend: I will be\nFriend: Backstage\nFriend: Vile\nFriend: Vip\nFriend: HAhahaha\nPersona: Hahahahah\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\nPersona: Hustler"

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

I\u2019m sad we don\u2019t overlap:/\nFriend: how's it going in the summerhouse? :)\nFriend: need to show you more photos then\nFriend: are u sure? \ud83d\ude31\nFriend: I think that\u2019s the first pic I\u2019ve seen of him\nFriend: Shiiiiiit\nFriend: I forgot until now:(\nFriend: Wanna call:)\nFriend: So much fun! I won in mini golf today\nFriend: How was Bornholm? :)\nFriend: Hm, I kinda hangover but just call and we see if I\u2018m still awake :)\nFriend: Is it possible 4 u 22?\nFriend: I\u2019m leaving Bornholm at that time approximately\nFriend: 17h is not good for you tomorrow?\nFriend: Like 22.00?\nFriend: What about Thursday evening (late)?\nFriend: I\u2018m fully booked tmrw \ud83d\ude22\nFriend: Or tmr?\nFriend: maybe just gonna call thursday then? :)\nFriend: I just came home from a shelter trip. 1 of my exams is coming to an end soon I hope\nFriend: I\u2019m currently half vacationing and half working on 2 of my exams:/\nFriend: I think there is a bigger miscomms between the manager that request new recourses and the HR person writing the job post tbf. So i think u should just throw out your cv 2 everyone, like a weapon of mass destruction!\nFriend: Eliastorjani\nFriend: What\u2019s your name on bereal?\nFriend: I would still apply even though they say u need 2 speak Danish;)\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nPersona: Its lit\nPersona: Where r u sitting?\nFriend: In the back\nFriend: But on my way to Cantine rn\nPersona: What number is your study group?\nFriend: 21\nFriend: Where r u\nPersona: Generally, your paragraphs are too short. It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\nPersona: My feedback^\nPersona: My assignment lol^\nFriend: Thank u !!!\nPersona: Np\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\nPersona: Yes\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\nFriend: Sorry\nPersona: np\nFriend: Jacob called you.\nFriend: Where should we meet?

But maybe it's a coincidence\nPersona: I\u2019ve been to the normal doctor, which have sent me to the specialist, whom I\u2019m calling tomorrow\nPersona: Good luck with all the surgery, let me know how it goes!\nFriend: I don\u2019t know how much blood you are loosing\nFriend: And for how long\nFriend: But I would\nSuggest ask for a blood test\nFriend: And check your levels of hemoglobin\nPersona: I actually had a blood test (unrelated to this) I'll check the haemoglobin now\nFriend: I got a phone call directly after mine\nFriend: And they asked me if I am still alive\nFriend: Hahaha\nPersona: What! Hahahahaha\nPersona: Because of the 3,7?\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\nPersona: I'll look\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nFriend: He is platforms dude\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nFriend: from him?\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\nFriend: perhaps\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nPersona: true\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nPersona: sounds accurate\nFriend: wait a sec\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\nPersona: Its lit\nPersona: Where r u sitting?\nFriend: In the back\nFriend: But on my way to Cantine rn\nPersona: What number is your study group?\nFriend: 21\nFriend: Where r u\nPersona: Generally, your paragraphs are too short. It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\nPersona: My feedback^\nPersona: My assignment lol^\nFriend: Thank u !!!\nPersona: Np\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\nPersona: Yes\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\nFriend: Sorry\nPersona: np\nFriend: Jacob called you.\nFriend: Where should we meet?

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nFriend: Hey, have you tried mindjet manager already?\nPersona: I gave it a quick shot here\nPersona: How r u sharing files? mail?\nPersona: Until I get used 2 it, I still only use it 4 post class notes. Like a \"midterm\" overview-ish\nFriend: I use google drive usually\nFriend: but otherwise airidas.brikas@gmail.com\nFriend: Take your time haha - in the end you'll feel what an awesome tool it is\nFriend: I will share my main DM map with you shortly\nPersona: I only used it 4 one module so far, but I can feel it has potential. I just need 2 get used 2 it, bc it's way faster in onenote 4 me still\nPersona: Thankyou 4 introducing me 2 it tho! I'm using this 1. semester 2 choose my \"tools\"\nPersona: do u use notion? just got an early access 2 an AI integration 4 scraping, if u r interrested?\nFriend: Mindjet gets faster later.\nFriend: You really like fast stuff I see with those 2, 4s \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: U learn hotkeys u flying\nPersona: Yeah, just Got used 2 it, can't go back now hahaha\nPersona: Not finished, just want 2 test sharing option\nPersona: 45FFF169-BABD4DE5-9D5923E6-ECB1F67B\nPersona: licens key\nFriend: I think its for mac only :D\nPersona: Damn I\u2019m sry:/\nFriend: \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nPersona: Can u remind me how we decided 2 organize?

If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book?

Keep the difference  in mind:\nFriend: Wtf\nFriend: Jesus christ\nFriend: Love u guys\nFriend: Jesus\nPersona: U get it?\nFriend: No\nPersona: The clown (penny wise) asks the kids if they want a balloon.

So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nFriend: from him?\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\nFriend: perhaps\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nPersona: true\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nPersona: sounds accurate\nFriend: wait a sec\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\nPersona: I\u2019m gonna be at cbs regardless\nFriend: Hm\nFriend: What are we going to talk about?\nFriend: Cause I am feeling lazy and maybe online meet would do\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0e\nPersona: Idk, what do u think?\nFriend: yah you showed me your map on Tuesday\nFriend: Nah I'll stay home, work at my own, but thanks for the invite.\nFriend: What I thing we could do:\n1) Like you said, I show you how to fix the green highlightinf\n2) I will show you my own Econ anki cards, which at the time I made were actually really good, as they have graphs and it can help understand the concepts, not the math tho. \n3) We can setup SMS forwarding\nFriend: And yeah lets postpone it\nFriend: I am flexible all day today\nPersona: Sounds gr8\nPersona: Wanna call at 13?\nFriend: sure\nFriend: Can we postpone to 13:30?\nPersona: Yes\nPersona: Give me 2 min\nFriend: alright, no worriies I am also writing an email\nPersona: Was about 2 send u a link\nFriend: 60905504\nFriend: Hey man, can I get the code?\nFriend: Make me hungy and I'll find a way\nFriend: I am in\nFriend: I literally hacked your two factor auth xddd\nFriend: Their security system is so dumb\nFriend: without any hacking lol\nFriend: You'll laugh when I tell you about this\nFriend: Their security system is literally so flawed.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nPersona: Where r we meeting?\nFriend: Oh fuck.we had a meeting today??\nFriend: I literally forgot to put on my calendar\nFriend: where were we supposed to meet?\nFriend: when*\nPersona: No worries, I overslept 2\nPersona: Also I accidentally put it at 12 instead of 10, idk why\nPersona: Wanna move it 2 this afternoon, if u have time?\nFriend: Would it be a problem meeting on Thursday?\nPersona: That\u2019s cool\nPersona: 10 at sp?\nFriend: Okay, I make note!\nPersona: I\u2019ve updated the drive-folder I share with you\nPersona: Can I get access 2 this map?\nFriend: Its empty almost\nFriend: but yeah, send me your email\nPersona: Eliastorjani@gmail.com\nFriend: I shared with you\nFriend: Have you found if Aspiri thing can be shared?\nPersona: Unfortunately not. It has 2-factor authentication\nPersona: I\u2019ll buy it tonight, and grind the next few days\nFriend: What kind of content there is?\nFriend: Using any 3rd party app as the 2-nd factor or what?\nPersona: SMS code\nFriend: If we can find a way to share it then we can split\nFriend: hm, do you know if there is another way?\nPersona: It\u2019s our course specifically, is a dense/summarized version, thought by a 3rd party private firm\nFriend: Like an email? We can set auto-forward\nPersona: Idk yet, I\u2019ll let u know when I purchase\nFriend: Also we can autoforward sms\nFriend: If you get it today, and we can make it work with the autoforward 2 step auth, I can give you 50%\nFriend: I am at work right now, but\nFriend: I am deciding maybe I want to go to this\nFriend: If you want to we can go to this and try the automation after the event\nPersona: sure\nFriend: Does the event sound interesting?\nPersona: Personally I don\u2019t think so. But it match my time today\nFriend: We can also call up in the evening\nFriend: Okay\nFriend: sounds good\nPersona: Come if u want\nPersona: sps04\nFriend: hmm maybe maybe\nFriend: coming\nFriend: Is it an auditorium?\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I passed the Econ exam today\nFriend: but I still want to do econ lol\nPersona: Congrats!\nPersona: Relax hhhaahaha\nPersona: Enjoy the weather\nFriend: Thank\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Most of your Anki cards are empty\nFriend: wtf\nFriend: weird\nFriend: what are you using to see them?\nPersona: The anki desktop app\nPersona: Idk, I have plenty of content 2 practice on, I\u2019ll manage\nFriend: weird...\nFriend: i'll come soon to uni\nFriend: we can investigate if u have time\nPersona: Cool. I\u2019m out 4 some food rn. Maybe when I\u2019m back\nPersona: Will u send me the pic u took 4 me yesterday?\nPersona: Im back:)\nFriend: I am at the library but I am so lazy to get up xdd\nFriend: yh lol I see myself in the pic\nFriend: Hey, how was Econ? :D\nFriend: Did you know that you can search all of the linked maps at the same time?\nFriend: This is an amazing feature\nPersona: I blanked..:/\nPersona: My document crashed, and I only saved very early.

If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: you might have attached smth with big size,  and that might be why you get lag\nPersona: Is there a way 2 determine which topic take the most space?\nFriend: Make copy\nDelete 50% of topics\nIf size dropped significantly, means that its in that 50% you deleted. If not - its in the other part.\nGo one level deeper in that part.\nRepeat till you find it.\nFriend: Thats the only way I can think of :D\nPersona: U r thinking like a computer!\nPersona: Btw I have scratched my idea about the \u201cmass-producing NFT bot\u201d 4 now. I have smth else on my mind I wanna tell u about another time if u want\nPersona: U remember how I said we might be able 2 create a minmap from a book?

I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\nPersona: I did not get the job...\nFriend: Just to practice your French\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\nPersona: Still exited to watch\nFriend: I am in\nPersona: Nice job\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\nPersona: Home\nFriend: Coming\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\nFriend: No\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\nFriend: Saturday big game\nFriend: Final\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\nFriend: The whole office goes\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\nFriend: Sure\nFriend: I will be\nFriend: Backstage\nFriend: Vile\nFriend: Vip\nFriend: HAhahaha\nPersona: Hahahahah\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\nPersona: Hustler\nPersona: \ud83d\udcaf\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: CATS ARE AMAZINGGG\nPersona: Nope\nFriend: You must be kidding mee\nPersona: No\nFriend: Cats are the creators of the worldd\nPersona: Right\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Ohmg\nPersona: Not bad huh\nFriend: Not at all!\nFriend: What are u doing\nPersona: We just Got home\nPersona: The spa thing was a part of the apartment we rented\nFriend: Wtf\nFriend: Jesus christ\nFriend: Love u guys\nFriend: Jesus\nPersona: U get it?\nFriend: No\nPersona: The clown (penny wise) asks the kids if they want a balloon.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\nPersona: I did not get the job...\nFriend: Just to practice your French\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\nPersona: Still exited to watch\nFriend: I am in\nPersona: Nice job\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\nPersona: Home\nFriend: Coming\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\nFriend: No\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\nFriend: Saturday big game\nFriend: Final\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\nFriend: The whole office goes\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\nFriend: Sure\nFriend: I will be\nFriend: Backstage\nFriend: Vile\nFriend: Vip\nFriend: HAhahaha\nPersona: Hahahahah\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\nPersona: Hustler\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Its lit\nPersona: Where r u sitting?\nFriend: In the back\nFriend: But on my way to Cantine rn\nPersona: What number is your study group?\nFriend: 21\nFriend: Where r u\nPersona: Generally, your paragraphs are too short. It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\nPersona: I did not get the job...\nFriend: Just to practice your French\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\nPersona: Still exited to watch\nFriend: I am in\nPersona: Nice job\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\nPersona: Home\nFriend: Coming\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\nFriend: No\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\nFriend: Saturday big game\nFriend: Final\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\nFriend: The whole office goes\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\nFriend: Sure\nFriend: I will be\nFriend: Backstage\nFriend: Vile\nFriend: Vip\nFriend: HAhahaha\nPersona: Hahahahah\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\nPersona: Hustler\nPersona: I think Carsten's is good 2 go\nPersona: I made a mail that's both for Eric and Dan together, since it seems ingenuent if they talk about it together somehow\nPersona: Theirs is ready 4 review 2\nPersona: Just looked at IOANNA, and I thought about; why not just show up 2 her office hours tmr?\nPersona: Do you also simply divide out personalized cold emails so we send idea 1 and 2 to non-tech people, while 2 and 3 go to the technical people?\nPersona: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well.

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\nFriend: Send the same one twice\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them.

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

Maybe it\u2019s hard 2 talk about over text\nPersona: Yes!\nPersona: Me2! Am ready as early as u want;)\nFriend: Alright, so lets talk tommorow!\nFriend: What about 10-11am?\nPersona: Sounds good\nPersona: I\u2019ll be there at 10\nPersona: Got kicked, nvm\nFriend: I am just leaving\nFriend: if I can find a parking at SP I'll be quick\nPersona: No stress. I'm catching up in the meantime\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\nFriend: sp210?\nFriend: Airidas called you.\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\nFriend: no clue\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\nPersona: Not completely sure.

And also on MSPs?\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\nFriend: perhaps\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nPersona: true\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nPersona: sounds accurate\nFriend: wait a sec\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\nPersona: U did it again!\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\nPersona: I'm gonna focus on his literature. But I'll wake up early instead (my sleep rhythm got me waking up 6 naturally\nFriend: alright\nFriend: 6 is a good time, true A person\nFriend: Btw\nFriend: but thats a decade ago\nFriend: nvm, unrelated what I have deleted\nFriend: I mapped and read through the headline of a lot of research in Software Ecosystems, mapped for you some papers in markdown, to perhaps skim headlines. sorted by citation count / recency /relevance\nFriend: Also jotted down some potential things to study there\nFriend: Havent read them, but just tried to gain some meta understanding\nFriend: they maybe unrelated tho\nFriend: Not feeling too good about this meeting in terms of what to suggest we reseach and how\nFriend: Maybe you can look how to pivot off this paper\nFriend: I havent really done that\nFriend: ughh why 8am ughh\nFriend: are you up.mate?\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\nFriend: Free\nFriend: From 10.00 am\nPersona: No way\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\nFriend: Sure\nPersona: Hahahahah\nFriend: You can go Thursday\nFriend: With it\nPersona: Sounds crazy\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\nPersona: I'm so stoked\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\nFriend: No idea\nPersona: How is chile? Remember to use the go pro as much as possible\nFriend: On my way to the Easter island already\nPersona: Damn\nFriend: The wedding was crazy\nFriend: Found a girl as well\nPersona: Big surprise\nFriend: Hahahahaha\nFriend: Went to a restaurant called Denmark\nPersona: Looks fun^^\nPersona: Did they speak danish?\nFriend: Bro\nFriend: Why has nothing Danish\nFriend: There except the flag\nPersona: Lol, but why thogh\nPersona: Though*\nFriend: I don\u2019t know\nFriend: Hahaha\nFriend: Everything is messy here\nFriend: Chaos all over\nFriend: Loving it though\nPersona: I could imagine\nFriend: How is home?\nPersona: Chaos all over is also your style\nFriend: Love it\nFriend: Hahah\nFriend: You know me\nPersona: Just as usual, my big assignment has started, so I am in work mode\nFriend: Good luck\nPersona: Fam is just chilling and watching movies all the time\nPersona: Thx\nFriend: Did they change the windows?\nPersona: What Windows?\nFriend: Outside\nFriend: \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\nPersona: Idk anything about that lol\nFriend: Ok ok\nFriend: Cause my room is chaos cause I needed to move everything in case the windows got changed\nPersona: I\u2019ll ask them today\nPersona: I\u2019ll let u know\nFriend: Thanks bro\nFriend: Although it doesn\u2019t really matter\nPersona: No worries\nFriend: I have something for you you might like\nPersona: uuhhhh sounds nice, can't wait to see what it is\nPersona: have u heard about the situation with corona in Denmark? if u did not work here it would be almost imposible for u to get back home.

It has 2-factor authentication\nPersona: I\u2019ll buy it tonight, and grind the next few days\nFriend: What kind of content there is?\nFriend: Using any 3rd party app as the 2-nd factor or what?\nPersona: SMS code\nFriend: If we can find a way to share it then we can split\nFriend: hm, do you know if there is another way?\nPersona: It\u2019s our course specifically, is a dense/summarized version, thought by a 3rd party private firm\nFriend: Like an email? We can set auto-forward\nPersona: Idk yet, I\u2019ll let u know when I purchase\nFriend: Also we can autoforward sms\nFriend: If you get it today, and we can make it work with the autoforward 2 step auth, I can give you 50%\nFriend: I am at work right now, but\nFriend: I am deciding maybe I want to go to this\nFriend: If you want to we can go to this and try the automation after the event\nPersona: sure\nFriend: Does the event sound interesting?\nPersona: Personally I don\u2019t think so. But it match my time today\nFriend: We can also call up in the evening\nFriend: Okay\nFriend: sounds good\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*"

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

Perhaps lets do month and day?

Why do you need me to make a repo?\nFriend: Apprently you can create a git repository in a Google Drive folder\nFriend: But\nFriend: since I like to learn stuff, I will find a workaround\nFriend: I will do the script later, I got a little bit annoyed while bulding it\nFriend: For now I will manually move items to it from time to time\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this.

It has 2-factor authentication\nPersona: I\u2019ll buy it tonight, and grind the next few days\nFriend: What kind of content there is?\nFriend: Using any 3rd party app as the 2-nd factor or what?\nPersona: SMS code\nFriend: If we can find a way to share it then we can split\nFriend: hm, do you know if there is another way?\nPersona: It\u2019s our course specifically, is a dense/summarized version, thought by a 3rd party private firm\nFriend: Like an email? We can set auto-forward\nPersona: Idk yet, I\u2019ll let u know when I purchase\nFriend: Also we can autoforward sms\nFriend: If you get it today, and we can make it work with the autoforward 2 step auth, I can give you 50%\nFriend: I am at work right now, but\nFriend: I am deciding maybe I want to go to this\nFriend: If you want to we can go to this and try the automation after the event\nPersona: sure\nFriend: Does the event sound interesting?\nPersona: Personally I don\u2019t think so. But it match my time today\nFriend: We can also call up in the evening\nFriend: Okay\nFriend: sounds good\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\nFriend: Just learning for now\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\nPersona: Yes, why?\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\nPersona: No api\nFriend: nice\nFriend: my man\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\nPersona: What do u use?\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\nFriend: I am using Prompta\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\nFriend: issue*\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\nFriend: hmm\nFriend: ahh but its paid\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\nFriend: tier*\nPersona: Lol.\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Lololll\nPersona: This should be illegal\nPersona: And this\nFriend: I know\nFriend: Lmaoooo\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\nFriend: Nooo\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\nFriend: One day I willll\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\nFriend: from him?\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them?

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\nPersona: My feedback^\nPersona: My assignment lol^\nFriend: Thank u !!!\nPersona: Np\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\nPersona: Yes\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\nFriend: Sorry\nPersona: np\nFriend: Jacob called you.\nFriend: Where should we meet?

With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough.

I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: I think should be not\nPersona: Interesting!

But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nFriend: He is platforms dude\nPersona: Perfect then!

When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\nFriend: from him?\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\nFriend: perhaps\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\nPersona: true\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\nFriend: Dude\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\nPersona: sounds accurate\nFriend: wait a sec\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\nPersona: U did it again!\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\nPersona: I'm gonna focus on his literature. But I'll wake up early instead (my sleep rhythm got me waking up 6 naturally\nFriend: alright\nFriend: 6 is a good time, true A person\nFriend: Btw\nFriend: but thats a decade ago\nFriend: nvm, unrelated what I have deleted\nFriend: I mapped and read through the headline of a lot of research in Software Ecosystems, mapped for you some papers in markdown, to perhaps skim headlines. sorted by citation count / recency /relevance\nFriend: Also jotted down some potential things to study there\nFriend: Havent read them, but just tried to gain some meta understanding\nFriend: they maybe unrelated tho\nFriend: Not feeling too good about this meeting in terms of what to suggest we reseach and how\nFriend: Maybe you can look how to pivot off this paper\nFriend: I havent really done that\nFriend: ughh why 8am ughh\nFriend: are you up.mate?"

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.
