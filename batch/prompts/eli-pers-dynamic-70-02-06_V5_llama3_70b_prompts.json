He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\\nFriend: its much more relax\\nPersona: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\\nPersona: What is it?\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: how was it?\\nPersona: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\\nFriend: ai chat\\nPersona: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\\nPersona: They loved it!\\nFriend: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: :Ddddd\\nFriend: you must try character.ai\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: We r going 2 the pyramid.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Miss u 2!\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Love it\\nFriend: Aaaaah so cute omg!!!!\\nFriend: What happened???\\nPersona: I blackouted and hit my head yesterday\\nFriend: Oh Nikki\\nFriend: Noooo * wtf ahahaha\\nFriend: But is it serious?\\nPersona: It\u2019s okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s really nice\\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Lol.\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Such a cringe movie\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA\\nFriend: I haven\u2019t finished it yet !!\\nFriend: The concept is interesting but so weirddd\\nPersona: I Swear some people will end up like this guy in ten years, introducing Siri AS Their girlfriend\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: I\u2019m sure some ppl already do HAHAHA\\nPersona: Hahahahah might be true\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Say hi to Ava from Denmark if you\u2019re still with her\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: Hahahahaha nice pic\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Lololll\\nPersona: This should be illegal\\nPersona: And this\\nFriend: I know\\nFriend: Lmaoooo\\nPersona: U r 2 Young for the stripclub\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew\\nFriend: Where did u FIND THIS\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nPersona: It\u2019s up On ur Facebook hahahahaha\\nFriend: Nooo\\nPersona: Jk\ud83e\udd2a\\nPersona: I think my dad took the pic when we visited u the first time\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Omg ew HAH\\nPersona: U should put up a video where u play, so I can flex my talented cuz!\ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: HAHAHAHAHAHAHA\\nFriend: One day I willll\\nFriend: I was just playing accompaniment for the singer\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Syntes godt om en besked\\nFriend: Hiiii\\nFriend: Happy late birthday!!!!!\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\\nPersona: Thanks diba\ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: Hello!!

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: How was Yesterday\\nFriend: Good\\nFriend: How about you\\nPersona: Pretty mit\\nPersona: Lig\\nPersona: Kit\\nFriend: Hahaha\\nPersona: Lit*\\nFriend: Seems like it\\nPersona: Hahahah\\nFriend: You get with any girls\\nPersona: Yeah, i knew her already tho\\nPersona: Wbu?\\nFriend: Ahh no\\nFriend: But I didn\u2019t really try\\nFriend: I was very drunk\\nPersona: U where the perfect condition\\nPersona: Did u go 2 school?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: I wasn\u2019t feeling it\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: You called Christian.\\nFriend: U coming\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: Dope\\nFriend: Lmk when u here\\nFriend: Just tell me when ur here\\nFriend: Call me when u here\\nPersona: You called Christian.\\nFriend: Are you coming to sushi\\nPersona: At what time?

Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\\nFriend: ohh ur going today\\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel"

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then!

And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it).

An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses.

So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early.

I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\\nFriend: oh yeah sorry\\nFriend: wait\\nFriend: I asked a question to studenr hub about electives\\nFriend: 5 days ago\\nFriend: they say they asnwer in 7 days\\nFriend: So can you wait 2 more days haha?\\nPersona: No worries, I got time:)\\nFriend: Maybe you know the answer\\nFriend: Is it mandatory to write the thesis together with someone? Or it can be done alone too. It does not anywhere in the thesis guidelinea\\nFriend: guidelines*\\nPersona: Regarding\u2026?\\nPersona: Pretty sure u can do it alone, which was also my first consideration. But I changed my mind after talking with Kenya about social learning a year ago. I just believe the learning potential, and results would be better with multiple people (at least for me). I know many apparently prefer to write in groups of 2 (for whatever reason)\\nPersona: Which direction do u want 2 go w/ your thesis if u write alone? I believe it\u2019s easier 2 determine if any of us feels like the subject will compromise our own priorities, u get me?\\nFriend: That was my question \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: What did Kenya tell you, that changed your mind abour learning together?\\nFriend: I am not aware of the allowed directions, but would be either something data science, something with platforms or startups related. \nDepending on the topic, marketing or innovation might be interesting too.\\nFriend: Should we also call someday, discuss, brainstorm about it?\\nFriend: So you answered it haha, thx\\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea!

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc?

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hey man, you going for the cbs skii trip right?\\nPersona: Yea, r u?\\nFriend: I might, not sure yet\\nFriend: How much are u paying ?\\nPersona: Way 2 much I think hahah\\nPersona: 4 smth k\\nFriend: I think it\u2019s above 5k in total lol\\nFriend: Who are you staying in a room with?\\nPersona: Daniel and a couple of girls probably\\nFriend: Hey dude\\nFriend: Which options did you choose here?\\nPersona: I think I said no 2 everything except the bus, and then booked snowboard equipment through intersport\\nPersona: But let me double check 4 u in a few hours\\nFriend: Okay thx man\\nPersona: So only bus, housing and ski pass\\nFriend: Thank you\\nFriend: Got it\\nPersona: Np:)\\nFriend: Hey man, did you hear our ski room considers not going? lol\\nPersona: Yeah it\u2019s pretty messed up\\nPersona: I guess we should make a new group meeting hehe\\nFriend: Ya\\nFriend: Did the girls just tell you they'll keep you posted or?\\nPersona: Yes, but I think they\u2019ll cancel\\nFriend: True\\nPersona: It\u2019ll be fine.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure"

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Gonna go home soon\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: Is it realistic 2 be within an hour?\\nFriend: Just text me when u r ready:)\\nFriend: And haven\u2019t got food yet \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\\nFriend: We\u2019re still in the restaurant\\nFriend: Ayayayayayay\\nFriend: Yeah\\nFriend: Do you have time like 20h?\\nFriend: Just lmk when u r ready:)\\nFriend: It was chill enough.

It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\\nFriend: its much more relax\\nPersona: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\\nPersona: What is it?\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: how was it?\\nPersona: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\\nFriend: ai chat\\nPersona: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\\nPersona: They loved it!\\nFriend: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: :Ddddd\\nFriend: you must try character.ai\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Gonna go home soon\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: Is it realistic 2 be within an hour?\\nFriend: Just text me when u r ready:)\\nFriend: And haven\u2019t got food yet \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\\nFriend: We\u2019re still in the restaurant\\nFriend: Ayayayayayay\\nFriend: Yeah\\nFriend: Do you have time like 20h?\\nFriend: Just lmk when u r ready:)\\nFriend: It was chill enough.

So I need few minutes to find a quite spot \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Ah no worries, I think I can manage :) I\u2019d love to hear about it\\nFriend: I was just saying that I would like 2 talk 2 u about my paper if u have time and want 2 hear about it when we call. But it\u2019s totally fine, if you\u2019re pressured w time\\nFriend: Ah your sound is kinda bad. I didn\u2019t really understood. You have to give a presentation soon?\\nFriend: I think I\u2019m not having so much time. But we could just have a quick call if u want. Or would it be better for u writing at the is time?\\nFriend: R we calling today at the usual time?\\nFriend: I\u2019ll get the stuff;)\\nFriend: Cheaper than Rewe\\nFriend: You can get everything cheap at Lidl or Aldi\\nFriend: And Backpapier we do not use so often \ud83d\ude01 so I guess it\u2019s empty \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Hahaha, I didn\u2019t really get the beginning. \\nFriend: Sorry, we\u2019re little busy driving and finding food atm\\nFriend: That\u2019s my most lovely friend.

But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\\nFriend: And then use the dryer\\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40?

But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Is Emma with you?

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel"

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group.

Is there a way 2 include them w/o a separate social influence sim (the implementation I intuitively imagine)?\\nPersona: Everything makes sense 2 me\\nPersona: If I understand u correctly, I agree. KMS' r boring for specific organizations, and I would only find it interesting if we could approach it a bit more abstract/theoretical, 2 think of a general purpose (what I think u describe as \"external\"?) approach to knwl mgmt\\nFriend: we modify the code\\nFriend: publicy available knowledge management\\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc? I believe I tagged u\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: r these dogs ur friends or wild dogs?\\nFriend: Wild dogs\\nFriend: I mean\\nFriend: Stray dogs\\nFriend: Probably\\nFriend: The island was full with these\\nFriend: I adopted one for a day in my home\\nPersona: So cute\\nPersona: U should adopt them full time\ud83e\udd2a\\nPersona: So u can track the corona status\\nFriend: Thanks\\nFriend: I will have to be in quarantine for 14 days\\nFriend: when I come back\\nPersona: i know\\nPersona: no worries\\nPersona: You\u2019ve got a hair appointment tomorrow at 12 in the noon\\nFriend: Ok\\nFriend: Thanks\\nPersona: That is way too much Nikolay, I\u2019ll invite u on a chicken date at the place in Frederiksberg when they open again\\nFriend: It\u2019s why I pay for a haircut\\nPersona: That confirms that I have to introduce u to my barber\\nPersona: Chicken today?\\nFriend: I won\u2019t be able to I think I will play football\\nFriend: With the boys\\nPersona: no worries, another day\\nFriend: Hahahah\\nFriend: How is this done\\nFriend: And it looks so silly\\nPersona: It\u2019s with a 360 camera I think\\nPersona: With a mount on the hips, but the camera makes it invisible\\nFriend: It looks so silly\\nFriend: Hahahah\\nPersona: I Think it\u2019s kind of cool\\nPersona: U live in one of these apartments?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Florensvej 14\\nFriend: Is my address.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Did you get the code?\\nPersona: 97191\\nFriend: thanks\\nFriend: here is the cookie\\nPersona: New way?\\nFriend: fuck it does not wotk the pastebin\\nFriend: ok idk the cookie is here\\nFriend: Heyy, should we meet at cbs or online?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gonna be at cbs regardless\\nFriend: Hm\\nFriend: What are we going to talk about?\\nFriend: Cause I am feeling lazy and maybe online meet would do\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0e\\nPersona: Idk, what do u think?\\nFriend: yah you showed me your map on Tuesday\\nFriend: Nah I'll stay home, work at my own, but thanks for the invite.\\nFriend: What I thing we could do:\n1) Like you said, I show you how to fix the green highlightinf\n2) I will show you my own Econ anki cards, which at the time I made were actually really good, as they have graphs and it can help understand the concepts, not the math tho. \n3) We can setup SMS forwarding\\nFriend: And yeah lets postpone it\\nFriend: I am flexible all day today\\nPersona: Sounds gr8\\nPersona: Wanna call at 13?\\nFriend: sure\\nFriend: Can we postpone to 13:30?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: Give me 2 min\\nFriend: alright, no worriies I am also writing an email\\nPersona: Was about 2 send u a link\\nFriend: 60905504\\nFriend: Hey man, can I get the code?\\nFriend: Make me hungy and I'll find a way\\nFriend: I am in\\nFriend: I literally hacked your two factor auth xddd\\nFriend: Their security system is so dumb\\nFriend: without any hacking lol\\nFriend: You'll laugh when I tell you about this\\nFriend: Their security system is literally so flawed.

The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps?

Go hard on your vacation!;)\\nFriend: c\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcs, boy! You need to go vegetarian for at least one week as a penalty. I'll call a friend and ask if he could take care of it. Alisa got sick unfortunately\\nFriend: Hej hej, hope everything's fine back in CPH :) Unfortunately, I won't have time today to call. \ud83d\ude0c Maybe next week? I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\\nFriend: How\u2019s your trip back? \u263a\ufe0f\\nFriend: Do I know the guy in the middle?\\nFriend: Got it;)\\nFriend: Oki?\\nFriend: Keys for apartment and house in mailbox and key for mailbox on top of it\\nFriend: Yes, but you never know. Maybe someone else will come and stay there\u2026\\nFriend: Naaah!\\nFriend: Nvm, I found it\\nFriend: I\u2019ll see if I can do it before I leave:)\\nFriend: Not even put them in the washer, without starting it?\\nFriend: On top of your mailbox or in your apartment? Don\u2019t u have 1 more key 2 the apartment?\\nFriend: First thing first. What is the snoppy italian called again? I\u2019ll save it 2 my maps this time\\nFriend: And water the plants. The \u201ethirsty\u201c parts are pretty sure dead parts. It happens to plants from time to time.they loose leaves. You could take them off, if you feel like. That could help them :)\\nFriend: The next guest or Phil can just wash them\\nFriend: You can leave the sheets on\\nFriend: Hahahaha, watched the videos\\nFriend: Hmhmhm, you can leave them in our mailbox and the key for the mailbox on top of it \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Ah Alisa was texting me: u leaving at 4 tmrw morning\\nFriend: It\u2019s Paul-Robeson-Stra\u00dfe 36.

This way, you could at least have feedback for the next paper/re-exam :)\\nFriend: I see, the analysis is always the hardest, I\u2019d say. \ud83d\ude0c but maybe you don\u2019t have to be so \u201econcrete\u201c? Maybe you can argue for whatever point you wanna make, with sources you already have?\\nFriend: Hm, maybe you have to think of different steps and loops you have to take to finish an essay/paper. Did you work with a writing plan?\\nFriend: I wish I could learn how 2 convert my time-mgmt mistakes 2 \u201crules\u201d 4 myself the next time, but it always seem 2 be completely new:(\\nFriend: I do\\nFriend: Already at the smoothie place tho. It\u2019s good!\\nFriend: I\u2019d rather Hand in at the re-exam (it\u2019s the same assignment) than 2 hand in smth I\u2019m not proud of. The conclusion paragraph won\u2019t be hard, it\u2019s the analysis stuff that bugs me - 2 find citations from old academics on a future topic\\nFriend: It\u2019s one of your first papers. I think, you don\u2019t have to be perfect. You can see it as a first trial, no? :) and in any case you learned a lot for the next time regarding time management and structuring stuff. :)\\nFriend: Do you have grammarly or a similar Programm? I think, it would help to let it run through something like this? :) just to have some quick fixes \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Also if you want to safe some time, you can also just go to Caf\u00e9 Kraft to work from there. Therefore, you don\u2019t have to commute.\\nFriend: Hi there \u2600\ufe0f \\nFriend: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it:/\\nFriend: 5.

So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me.

Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I will try these you sent me\\nFriend: But by the name it sounds like its limited to trackpad or mouse\\nPersona: I think its able to modify all input interfaces\\nFriend: oh, in that case I shall try it\\nPersona: Yeah better touch tool is actually the only 1 I recommend all the way\\nFriend: This prompt works pretty well.\\nFriend: I just copy paste some info from the top of the document that looks relevant\\nFriend: Spews me out a bibliography entry and an in text citation\\nPersona: Don't u use a reference manager?\\nPersona: I've been busy w/ exams. Do u feel like catching up soon and contact potential supervisors?:)\\nFriend: hey me too\\nFriend: can we catch up after new year?\\nPersona: Sounds good!\\nFriend: What is your timezone, my fella?\\nFriend: Back in Denmark?\\nPersona: Ill be back the 5th;)\\nFriend: Hey, should we call up tommorow?\\nFriend: And welcome back!\\nPersona: Perhaps we can wait until Monday after noon. I'm busy w/ DO reexam\\nFriend: sure thing!\\nFriend: Hey, I didn't really look at it much during the holiday. Tommorow I will open up my notes, start reading up more in depth about these topics. Perhaps finally read some example thesis\\nPersona: Dont stress it. I'll also look into getting a more organized overview somtetime today. Then we can maybe catch up tmr evening or smth?\\nFriend: I have a danish class\\nFriend: what about thursday evening?\\nFriend: this is the topics I think we both matched on interest, but I may have missed some\\nPersona: Got football practice in the evening. Tmr morning irl at cbs instead?\\nFriend: I have work tommorow\\nFriend: what about Friday at CBS?\\nFriend: I am free almost whole day\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! How early r u comfortable with Friday? I'm celebrating Christmas that \"evening\"\\nFriend: Honestly, my current goal is as early at 8am\\nFriend: so I can find parking close to SP without needing to park and walk from dalgas\\nFriend: I plan to stay whole day and just work on thesis, masters research & stuff :D\\nPersona: Cool! I\u2019m living right next 2 Dalgas atm\\nPersona: I will do my absolute best to 2 wake up as early as u 2 then!\\nFriend: no no dont need to match me\\nFriend: come anytime\\nFriend: I will use my solo time wisely before u come\\nFriend: Don't wake up early for me btw, I might end up taking the bus and coming at 9\\nPersona: Sounds good.

Is there a way 2 include them w/o a separate social influence sim (the implementation I intuitively imagine)?\\nPersona: Everything makes sense 2 me\\nPersona: If I understand u correctly, I agree. KMS' r boring for specific organizations, and I would only find it interesting if we could approach it a bit more abstract/theoretical, 2 think of a general purpose (what I think u describe as \"external\"?) approach to knwl mgmt\\nFriend: we modify the code\\nFriend: publicy available knowledge management\\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\\nFriend: ohh ur going today\\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: How was Yesterday\\nFriend: Good\\nFriend: How about you\\nPersona: Pretty mit\\nPersona: Lig\\nPersona: Kit\\nFriend: Hahaha\\nPersona: Lit*\\nFriend: Seems like it\\nPersona: Hahahah\\nFriend: You get with any girls\\nPersona: Yeah, i knew her already tho\\nPersona: Wbu?\\nFriend: Ahh no\\nFriend: But I didn\u2019t really try\\nFriend: I was very drunk\\nPersona: U where the perfect condition\\nPersona: Did u go 2 school?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: I wasn\u2019t feeling it\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: You called Christian.\\nFriend: U coming\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: Dope\\nFriend: Lmk when u here\\nFriend: Just tell me when ur here\\nFriend: Call me when u here\\nPersona: You called Christian.\\nFriend: Are you coming to sushi\\nPersona: At what time?

The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before.

Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc? I believe I tagged u"

Can u plz talk 2 him? I think he\u2019s feeling lonely since everybody defaults 2 their mother tongue, and everyone but him got an exclusive language - as well as established lives already in the city. I think u have been the best example I\u2019ve seen of establishing contact in a place similar 2 Sam\u2019s situation. Sry 4 ranting.

Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me.

But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I will try these you sent me\\nFriend: But by the name it sounds like its limited to trackpad or mouse\\nPersona: I think its able to modify all input interfaces\\nFriend: oh, in that case I shall try it\\nPersona: Yeah better touch tool is actually the only 1 I recommend all the way\\nFriend: This prompt works pretty well.\\nFriend: I just copy paste some info from the top of the document that looks relevant\\nFriend: Spews me out a bibliography entry and an in text citation\\nPersona: Don't u use a reference manager?\\nPersona: I've been busy w/ exams.

Is there a way 2 include them w/o a separate social influence sim (the implementation I intuitively imagine)?\\nPersona: Everything makes sense 2 me\\nPersona: If I understand u correctly, I agree. KMS' r boring for specific organizations, and I would only find it interesting if we could approach it a bit more abstract/theoretical, 2 think of a general purpose (what I think u describe as \"external\"?) approach to knwl mgmt\\nFriend: we modify the code\\nFriend: publicy available knowledge management\\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Gonna go home soon\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: Is it realistic 2 be within an hour?\\nFriend: Just text me when u r ready:)\\nFriend: And haven\u2019t got food yet \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\\nFriend: We\u2019re still in the restaurant\\nFriend: Ayayayayayay\\nFriend: Yeah\\nFriend: Do you have time like 20h?\\nFriend: Just lmk when u r ready:)\\nFriend: It was chill enough.

Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc? I believe I tagged u\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\\nFriend: its much more relax\\nPersona: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\\nPersona: What is it?\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: how was it?\\nPersona: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\\nFriend: ai chat\\nPersona: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\\nPersona: They loved it!\\nFriend: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: :Ddddd\\nFriend: you must try character.ai\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Found a room\\nPersona: Top floor library room. DH.C.211\\nFriend: i cant find it wtf\\nFriend: does ir even exist?\\nFriend: maybe its \u00d82.111\\nFriend: sheez I got a cafeeine crash here\\nFriend: THis dude is literally what we need\\nFriend: I think we should personalzie for him a bit\\nPersona: He almost seem 2 good 2 be true! Let's get him\\nFriend: I'll write him an email\\nPersona: R u still at Dalgas? Just came back from the apartment tour\\nFriend: Yeah I am at dalgas\\nPersona: I'll come 2 u\\nPersona: Same room?\\nFriend: yup\\nFriend: Would be so fun include this if we go with this topic\\nFriend: We are living in such a cool time\\nPersona: It's def the most up 2 date example. I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it. If not, I will read smth else about our three topics.\\nFriend: and l'll send those two emails in a bit\\nPersona: Can u tell me online?\\nPersona: Don't feel pressured 2 dive deep into MaaSim\\nPersona: Finished rony's mail\\nPersona: Gave input on Rob's\\nPersona: I think Carsten's is good 2 go\\nPersona: I made a mail that's both for Eric and Dan together, since it seems ingenuent if they talk about it together somehow\\nPersona: Theirs is ready 4 review 2\\nPersona: Just looked at IOANNA, and I thought about; why not just show up 2 her office hours tmr?\\nPersona: Do you also simply divide out personalized cold emails so we send idea 1 and 2 to non-tech people, while 2 and 3 go to the technical people?\\nPersona: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well. Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?"

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately.

Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same."

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Miss u 2!\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Love it\\nFriend: Aaaaah so cute omg!!!!\\nFriend: What happened???\\nPersona: I blackouted and hit my head yesterday\\nFriend: Oh Nikki\\nFriend: Noooo * wtf ahahaha\\nFriend: But is it serious?\\nPersona: It\u2019s okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s really nice\\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I\u2019ve send them your info, now it\u2019s in their ballpark if they\u2019ll contact u;)\\nFriend: Transformation and Innovation Management is my specialisation \ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: Hahah, it\u2019s called Sustainability Management \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: I might have a small job 4 u.

Maybe you can argue for whatever point you wanna make, with sources you already have?\\nFriend: Hm, maybe you have to think of different steps and loops you have to take to finish an essay/paper.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I see you are enjoying the monkeys\\nPersona: Yeah They where sweet, except when they stole my moms sandwich\\nFriend: Did you pet them?\\nPersona: No actually not, my parents said it was a bad idea\\nPersona: Any news about Bella sky or guldsmeden?\\nFriend: I will need your cv\\nPersona: I Will send it to u now\\nFriend: I will send it to her. She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Did you get the code?\\nPersona: 97191\\nFriend: thanks\\nFriend: here is the cookie\\nPersona: New way?\\nFriend: fuck it does not wotk the pastebin\\nFriend: ok idk the cookie is here\\nFriend: Heyy, should we meet at cbs or online?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gonna be at cbs regardless\\nFriend: Hm\\nFriend: What are we going to talk about?\\nFriend: Cause I am feeling lazy and maybe online meet would do\ud83c\udfd6\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0e\\nPersona: Idk, what do u think?\\nFriend: yah you showed me your map on Tuesday\\nFriend: Nah I'll stay home, work at my own, but thanks for the invite.\\nFriend: What I thing we could do:\n1) Like you said, I show you how to fix the green highlightinf\n2) I will show you my own Econ anki cards, which at the time I made were actually really good, as they have graphs and it can help understand the concepts, not the math tho. \n3) We can setup SMS forwarding\\nFriend: And yeah lets postpone it\\nFriend: I am flexible all day today\\nPersona: Sounds gr8\\nPersona: Wanna call at 13?\\nFriend: sure\\nFriend: Can we postpone to 13:30?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: Give me 2 min\\nFriend: alright, no worriies I am also writing an email\\nPersona: Was about 2 send u a link\\nFriend: 60905504\\nFriend: Hey man, can I get the code?\\nFriend: Make me hungy and I'll find a way\\nFriend: I am in\\nFriend: I literally hacked your two factor auth xddd\\nFriend: Their security system is so dumb\\nFriend: without any hacking lol\\nFriend: You'll laugh when I tell you about this\\nFriend: Their security system is literally so flawed.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\\nPersona: I'm so stoked\\nPersona: So it's basically just a normal ticket after?\\nPersona: Do u know what SSN is?\\nFriend: No idea\\nPersona: How is chile?

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure"

It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\\nFriend: its much more relax\\nPersona: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\\nPersona: What is it?\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: how was it?\\nPersona: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail.

Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\\nFriend: ahh git is really fucking with me. Why do you need me to make a repo?\\nFriend: Apprently you can create a git repository in a Google Drive folder\\nFriend: But\\nFriend: since I like to learn stuff, I will find a workaround\\nFriend: I will do the script later, I got a little bit annoyed while bulding it\\nFriend: For now I will manually move items to it from time to time\\nPersona: Ill be at DS 12 w/ u\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: wya?\\nFriend: oh fuck\\nFriend: I am.in wronf one\\nPersona: 2.08 In 1 sec\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc? I believe I tagged u\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\\nFriend: What about Sunday?\\nPersona: Cool! Any time u prefer?\\nFriend: I am flexible all day, you choose.\\nFriend: Our usual morning time is good\\nPersona: Me2\\nPersona: What time is that in DK again?\\nPersona: 10? Or 11?\\nFriend: lets say 11\\nFriend: can we do 12, I got to sleep a bit too late \ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: Yeah no;)\\nFriend: hey mate, I am feeling a bit unwell today \ud83d\ude41 Sorry about that\\nFriend: Lets postpone it to next week if you can\\nPersona: Np, get well soon!:)\\nPersona: So Thursday at 11?\\nPersona: Just lmk when it suits u most;)\\nFriend: Hey mate sorry, I feel into the gaming trap and got totally addicted for a few days\\nFriend: 13:30 is prob a bit too late for you in shanghai I assume\\nFriend: Cause i have a lecture before that\\nFriend: So either that on Saturday 11?\\nPersona: No worries. What game r u into?\\nPersona: I think Saturday 11 is best 4 me:)\\nPersona: U up?:)\\nFriend: up \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Rimworld \ud83d\udc40\\nPersona: Cool I'm headed home. Probs about 20m late\\nFriend: okay\\nFriend: Eating breakfast, so +10 min to your 20 \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Cool! I'm home now, I'll get ready and send a link for 11.30\\nPersona: whatup:)\\nFriend: sorry 5 more mins\\nPersona: no stress\\nPersona: what's up?\\nPersona: U ready?\\nFriend: Shit, I totally forgot \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I havent looked into topics or anything\\nPersona: Me neither\\nPersona: Let's just talk anyway\\nPersona: I've been busy 2, so don't worry:)\\nFriend: Okay, give me a sec\\nPersona: alright. I've said yes 2 go see a christmas market thing, so would it be cool w/ u if we make it a 1h-long meeting max?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Obedience to Authority\\nFriend: what happened?\\nFriend: Been using Mac for a while now and at work I like it. One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\\nFriend: For example these lines, specifically only triggered when Adobe Acrobat is open saved me so much hassle\\nFriend: Adobe acrobat is very limited in key remappings, so with Autohotkey I can bypass that. Also the annoying copy paste behavior where it adds line breaks is annoying as hell, so this fixes it\\nFriend: Most of then I used for Mindmanager\\nFriend: But I have already made some for Logseq. Already quite a lot I had to make a hotkey to show available hotkeys\\nFriend: Perhaps you know anything similar on MacOS?\\nFriend: This is quite ridiculous\\nPersona: I use better touch tool (if u have the touchbar this is by far the best), but I heard keyboard maestro should be nice as well\\nPersona: Lmao\\nPersona: Lmk if it solves anything 4 u:)\\nPersona: What is .ahk? Which language is that?\\nFriend: Autohotkey\\nFriend: But its only for windows\\nFriend: I will try these you sent me\\nFriend: But by the name it sounds like its limited to trackpad or mouse\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good.

Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents.

But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8!

He\u2019s literally buddha!\\nFriend: Loooool!\\nFriend: The king of Berlin is back!\ud83d\ude0e\\nFriend: Not as far as I know\\nFriend: Did scooters get baned in Berlin?\\nFriend: Your oven makes some noises I haven\u2019t heard any other oven make\\nFriend: you can also always go for \"mishba\" (burritos) or \"dean&david\" (bowls+salad- but too expensive from my pov) there are everywhere\\nFriend: perfect plan! library is open till 22h as far as I know :)\\nFriend: there's an asian take-away but portions little small. people are super nice though. seems like they dont have google maps. the name is 5 ace\\nFriend: they have cheap and yummy lunch - i think we've been there. it's not take-away though\\nFriend: never tried but got it recommended\\nFriend: insanely good and fresh mexican food but the portions a little small\\nFriend: they have insanely good smoothies and juices - i guess they also have some stuff which is healthy and to eat\\nFriend: and veeeeery good\\nFriend: this is vegtebale kebab - at least better than with meat \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: you could just take a pad-thai for take-away\\nFriend: you've been here with us in summer\\nFriend: bowls stuff\\nFriend: very healthy + very good\\nFriend: perfect!\\nFriend: hahahhahaha, love it!\\nFriend: Yes \ud83d\ude01\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re all big\u2026 is it the denim-ish fabric ones that can\u2019t handle more that 30?\\nFriend: Don\u2019t worry, I got the washing machine doing it\u2019s thing\\nFriend: This crazy and takes long time. But ofc u can do that. It\u2019s for big pillowcases right? I think some of the small ones can only be washed 30 degrees\\nFriend: Oh shitty, we had other guests staying before u. So we don\u2019t really know where the others could be\\nFriend: Is hygiene ok? It can do 60. Also i found the washing powder and put it in the middle section\\nFriend: Only 1, and I think it\u2019s made 4 a different size pillows\\nFriend: U can also use shampoo in the worst case \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: It\u2019s on the left cupboard\\nFriend: Ah is there still washing stuff like soap for the washing machine?\\nFriend: And then use the dryer\\nFriend: Ahaaa, there were no pillow cases on top of the locker?\\nFriend: Which setting is the 2 defaults? 60/40? I need 2 wash some pillow cases\\nFriend: Found it\\nFriend: Thx 4 all of the recommendations! I\u2019ll check the ones I have time 4 out<3\\nFriend: That\u2019s very cute of u. But it\u2019s just me on a writer retreat:)\\nFriend: And for the others you can just ask for a \u201etrial class\u201c. Normally they give u a price between 8-12\u20ac then\\nFriend: I think at the last one is the one you can just pay cash as much ad you want\\nFriend: These are my favorite studios\\nFriend: Can u find it? :)\\nFriend: There\u2019s a bunch called that on App Store, will u send a screenshot?:)\\nFriend: It\u2019s just that it says my name and profile picture at the check-in but I could just change my Profil picture to a photo of her and give her the login \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Is Emma with you? Because she could use my app for yoga. That way she wouldn\u2019t have to pay \ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: You can just eat and take whatever you need and want. \u263a\ufe0f\\nFriend: Ah and please water the plants (only inside, we\u2018ll start outside after we\u2018re back) \ud83d\ude07\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\\nFriend: its much more relax\\nPersona: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\\nPersona: What is it?\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: how was it?\\nPersona: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\\nFriend: ai chat\\nPersona: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\\nPersona: They loved it!\\nFriend: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: :Ddddd\\nFriend: you must try character.ai\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\\nFriend: ohh ur going today\\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: You sent a live location.\\nPersona: U come here and we\u2019ll go together\\nFriend: Tbh I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m making it I have a terrible hangover from last night and can feel my brain pounding through my head\\nPersona: I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019ll get some will be my main mission!\\nPersona: Come\\nPersona: You sent a live location.\\nFriend: Bruh idk\\nPersona: Come\\nPersona: Christian missed your call.\\nFriend: I\u2019m in the shower hold\nI\u2019m\\nPersona: Christian missed your call.\\nPersona: Text me\\nPersona: Come 2 the party\\nPersona: Vanklae\\nPersona: Vanklsr\\nPersona: Vanl\u00f8se\\nPersona: You called Christian.\\nPersona: What did I say on the phone yesterday?\\nFriend: HHhah\\nPersona: Sounds bad hahaha\\nFriend: It\u2019s all good\\nFriend: Sorry I didn\u2019t make it to the party last night\\nPersona: No worries! Apparently I was a menace 4 a solid 10 min before I fell asleep\\nFriend: Hahahah\\nFriend: That\u2019s hilarious\\nPersona: Did u end up applying 4 Monash?\\nFriend: Yes\\nPersona: As your first priority? I am between that and Queensland for my 4th\\nFriend: That was my first\\nPersona: Do u think they\u2019ll let multiple people from DM go the same place?\\nFriend: Ywah\\nFriend: After they fucked up this exam thing\\nPersona: ?\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: Was trying to say yeah\\nPersona: So u would keep Monash if u were me?\\nFriend: Yeah why not\\nPersona: Cool\\nPersona: Can u give me some pointers regarding 2nd round exchange 4 US universities late afternoon/this evening?:)\\nPersona: I have considered Richmond, but idk\\nFriend: Yeah for sure\\nFriend: What were you thinking\\nPersona: I could sent u a list of options, and u could warn me of the few u think r bad, and tell me if any sounds nice\\nFriend: Ywah\\nFriend: Send them\\nPersona: I want 2 go 2 a \u201cliberal arts\u201d I think???(where u live on campus)\\nPersona: I\u2019ll send them when I get back:)\\nFriend: Okay send them later\\nFriend: Wdym by liberal arts\\nFriend: The ones I crossed are good schools\\nPersona: U don\u2019t like richmond?\\nPersona: I was told that\u2019s the name of schools where they have on campus housing, and that these r stereotypical american\\nFriend: So liberal arts schools are schools that focus on subjects like theater. English and that stuff\\nFriend: The only reason to go to Virgina is if your going to the university of Virginia\\nFriend: That just says Richmond\\nPersona: I\u2019ll cancel richmond then. Might only apply 4 wisconsin madison then\\nPersona: Which of Maryland, Emory and Purdue would u prefer?\\nFriend: Purdue\\nFriend: It\u2019s probably the most normal\\nPersona: Can I get u 2 send this again please?<3\\nFriend: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019ve requested access\\nPersona: What\u2019s your status?\\nFriend: I\u2019m going home to drop my bag off\\nFriend: And then I\u2019ll head over\\nPersona: Cool cool\\nFriend: Hey I\u2019ll be there in like 10 is that cool\\nFriend: Hey I\u2019m here\\nPersona: I\u2019ll pick u up in a sec\\nFriend: You missed a call from Christian."

And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\\nPersona: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\\nPersona: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\\nFriend: Yeah this one should be better\\nFriend: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\\nPersona: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\\nFriend: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\\nPersona: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\\nFriend: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\\nPersona: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\\nFriend: THe GPT on Google is nice\\nFriend: but I can't find the summarizer\\nFriend: Is it this one?\\nPersona: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\\nFriend: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\\nFriend: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\\nPersona: Ofc;)\\nFriend: Alright I'll get it\\nPersona: R u at CBS?\\nFriend: Hey, nah at home, studying\\nFriend: but whats up?\\nPersona: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\\nPersona: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\\nFriend: Which excel sheet?\\nPersona: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\\nFriend: I see, wait\\nFriend: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\\nPersona: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\\nFriend: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\\nFriend: In my study group we made a new template\\nFriend: If you want, I can share this with you\\nFriend: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\\nPersona: Would appreciate that<3\\nFriend: The sheet at the end are not really templates\\nFriend: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\\nFriend: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\\nFriend: sheets*\\nPersona: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\\nFriend: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\\nPersona: Thanks bro!\\nFriend: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\\nFriend: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\\nFriend: well*\\nPersona: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\\nFriend: Hey, have you used Notion?\\nPersona: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\\nPersona: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\\nFriend: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\\nPersona: I\u2019d be down 2 look into it next week. But 4 now I focus on my DO\\nPersona: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\\nFriend: yeah same\\nFriend: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\\nPersona: Yeah, why?\\nPersona: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\\nPersona: Forgot it was exercise class\\nFriend: umm\\nFriend: Yeha if you are at cbs?\\nPersona: I\u2019m nearby, at station\\nPersona: I got until 14 if u want any help;)\\nFriend: damb what are you doing?\\nFriend: I still have a lecture\\nFriend: Its ending now, but I have a study group meeting\\nFriend: so idk maybe later, unless you want to join my study group meeting \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: 3d printing\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Basically stating the contents of the update\\nPersona: Good idea!\\nFriend: MCMR notes from today and yesterday date:10, date:11\\nPersona: R u at dalgas?\\nPersona: Could use some quick google drive advice, which I\u2019ve struggled with\\nFriend: nah I am at SP\\nPersona: When r u leaving?\\nPersona: I can come by after CMR\\nFriend: I'll probably stay in a library for a while.\\nFriend: sure\\nPersona: On my way!\\nFriend: sitting in 2 floor\\nFriend: 1st floot in danish terms lol\\nPersona: CMR is organised in 2 levels now\\nPersona: Will wait 2 update w/ your input till tmr, 2 make it more convenient 4 u\\nPersona: I will also wait with applying our tags till next week\\nFriend: great!\\nFriend: what do you mean?\\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\\nFriend: Maybe you took extra notes from slides?\\nPersona: Yes, it\u2019s nice. I was thinking about creating a big Micro calculator in excel 4 all the things we\u2019ve been through. But then Karol sort of made me rethink it, since the objective is 2 make us able 2 calculate and resonate as it is\\nPersona: Only what I did in class\\nFriend: That would take a while haha\\nFriend: Oh mee too yeah\\nPersona: Yes, and wouldn\u2019t be worth it\\nPersona: Updated CMR\\nPersona: ^Is this enough 2 say? Like r u able 2 find it, just by looking through tags?\\nFriend: ye all good\\nFriend: Same - Updated MCMR\\nPersona: I updated quite some stuff in Micro, and a little in ML\\nFriend: Hey man, thanks, I'll check it out!\\nPersona: Did a few micro notes yesterday, not anything special\\nFriend: Hey, don't delete the date tags yet for this month, I haven't copied info from yours yet\u0104\\nFriend: !*\\nPersona: I did some moving of topics\\nPersona: I didn\u2019t know how 2 show w/ tags. Let me show u after class\\nFriend: okay\\nPersona: Also, will u take a quick look at some some code which my group is struggling with?:)\\nFriend: Sure!\\nPersona: Thx\\nFriend: Mindmapping in VR\\nPersona: Yes yes yes and yes\\nPersona: ^Easy mindmap to anki conversion\\nPersona: Btw, do u have 30 min too help me with a minor machine learning problem at some point? (Preferably before noon tmr if possible):)\\nFriend: Hmm maybe\\nFriend: Whats the problem? I dont have time for a meet neither today nor tommorow as I am.working. But on Thursday I am free\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Jacob missed your call.\\nFriend: You missed a call from Jacob.\\nPersona: You called Jacob.\\nFriend: Dalgas have 15\\nFriend: Go on google maps\\nFriend: Should be a 10 min walk from bitlap\\nPersona: Thx\\nFriend: Did you go to the meeting today at 9?\\nPersona: No, I just arrived\\nPersona: U here?\\nFriend: No haha\\nFriend: But I\u2019ll come to the tour\\nFriend: Was just too tired in the morning\\nFriend: I know that the girls have a girls group chat. Should we make one too?\\nPersona: I just went home as well. I wanna sleep a bit before the tour\\nPersona: U didn't miss anything\\nPersona: Sure we could make one. Is it all of the girls in DM?\\nFriend: Probably not all of them but I thought a bigger group would be good to keep in touch\u2026\\nPersona: sure thing. But exclusively 4 boys?\\nPersona: Maybe we should just make 1 for everyone on FB?\\nFriend: No let\u2019s include girls\\nFriend: Yes\\nPersona: Let's mention it at the dinners\\nFriend: Perfect\\nFriend: When are u playing?\\nPersona: 14.00 probably\\nFriend: What bar r u going?\\nPersona: I'm about 2 leave\\nPersona: 2 meet the others\\nPersona: Idk where they're at/going tho\\nFriend: Ahh so u are going to the bar rn?\\nPersona: Idk, just wanna meet up and get drunk\\nFriend: Hahaha sounds good\\nPersona: Let's get out now\\nFriend: I\u2019ll be there in 35 min\\nPersona: You'll be late 4 a spot bro\\nFriend: Ok I\u2019m on my way\\nFriend: But I need 20 min\\nFriend: Can you save a spot for me\\nPersona: I'll do my best\\nPersona: Its lit\\nPersona: Where r u sitting?\\nFriend: In the back\\nFriend: But on my way to Cantine rn\\nPersona: What number is your study group?\\nFriend: 21\\nFriend: Where r u\\nPersona: Generally, your paragraphs are too short. It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet? I will be there in 15\\nPersona: Im On my way! En\\nPersona: En\\nPersona: Rn\\nPersona: R u in the library?\\nPersona: Can I borrow your charger again asap?:)\\nFriend: Sitting at the spot u saw me\\nPersona: Outside?\\nPersona: But you\u2019ll go back 2 the library?\\nFriend: Yes but I have to go to swapfiets now\\nFriend: Will be back in 30 min\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\\nFriend: ohh ur going today\\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel"

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist.

The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\\nFriend: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\\nFriend: In my study group we made a new template\\nFriend: If you want, I can share this with you\\nFriend: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\\nPersona: Would appreciate that<3\\nFriend: The sheet at the end are not really templates\\nFriend: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\\nFriend: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\\nFriend: sheets*\\nPersona: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\\nFriend: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\\nPersona: Thanks bro!\\nFriend: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\\nFriend: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\\nFriend: well*\\nPersona: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\\nFriend: Hey, have you used Notion?\\nPersona: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\\nPersona: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\\nFriend: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\\nPersona: I\u2019d be down 2 look into it next week. But 4 now I focus on my DO\\nPersona: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\\nFriend: yeah same\\nFriend: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\\nPersona: Yeah, why?\\nPersona: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\\nPersona: Forgot it was exercise class\\nFriend: umm\\nFriend: Yeha if you are at cbs?\\nPersona: I\u2019m nearby, at station\\nPersona: I got until 14 if u want any help;)\\nFriend: damb what are you doing?\\nFriend: I still have a lecture\\nFriend: Its ending now, but I have a study group meeting\\nFriend: so idk maybe later, unless you want to join my study group meeting \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: 3d printing\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: He had this project about education structure and learning, where he told me that the only \u201clearning strategy\u201d proved to be universally functional was social learning - in oppose to the benefits of visual learning, etc. (as far as I remember)\\nPersona: I thinks that\u2019s a good idea! My gf is visiting me until the 11th. So perhaps afterwards is ok?:)\\nFriend: Sounds good:)\\nPersona: Is tmr good 4 u?\\nFriend: Evening is good, maybe around 20 dk time?\\nPersona: That would be a bit 2 late 4 me. I\u2019m 6h ahead\u2026 perhaps tmr a bit earlier instead?\\nFriend: Alread lets do it tommorow. When can you?\\nPersona: I\u2019m flexible all of tmr. Hbu? Would prefer a bit early dk time\\nFriend: Yeah I am good anytime\\nPersona: Would noon be suitable?\\nFriend: Yeah, maybe at 13 dk time?\\nFriend: just woke uo\\nPersona: I figured, No stress;)\\nFriend: Is it fine in 20 mins?\\nPersona: Yeah\\nPersona: I\u2019m not home before in 5m anyway\\nFriend: Zoom :O\\nPersona: Not a fan?\\nPersona: We can use whatever\\nFriend: I am waiting in the meeting room haha\\nFriend: let me in\\nPersona: Hagelberg, Gus; Felber, Christian (2017): The Economy for Common Good. A Workable, Transformative Ethic-Based Alternative. Hg. v. The Next System Project. Washington D.C.\\nPersona: Claude\\nPersona: Shimmering focus theme\\nFriend: Making a note: Reinvent the business model for some domain.\\nFriend: BMVC had datadriven business model map.\\nFriend: Cause what we discussed a bunch about was business models, especially our data, fintech discussion\\nPersona: I can\u2019t remember the specific map. Was it in the lecture slides?\\nFriend: I will show you when I am on pc\\nFriend: Hey man, can we move our call to weekend? I got a bit obsessed with software dev and didn't think much about it\\nPersona: That\u2019s also even better 4 me. My brother lands today:)\\nPersona: What software dev caught u?\\nFriend: Mobile development with Flutter\\nFriend: I started a year ago, then stopped but got back to it last weekend\\nPersona: Smth specific u r creating, or just learning?\\nFriend: Just learning for now\\nFriend: Soon I will be creating an MVP for my idea\\nPersona: Would u mind having the meeting after Wednesday? My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\\nFriend: ohh ur going today\\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hey sorry got tired and weirdly stressed today at work haha\\nFriend: weirdly stressed in a good way I guess.\\nFriend: Got a fat raise\\nFriend: Jacob and Carsten seem to be only available from next week\\nFriend: And yeah lets do that I misunderstood the context, he didn't reply\\nFriend: send it\\nFriend: I going to work on thesis today\\nFriend: send some follow ups and do some reading, investigation on the topics, ideation for topic 3 perhaps\\nPersona: Congrats! Did they meet 190?\\nPersona: The video chat ended.\\nFriend: yeah lets do it\\nFriend: oh wait nvm\\nFriend: I thought you texted me, but I was just reading an old message xddd\\nFriend: what is the table with LLMs you always bring up?\\nPersona: Chatbot arena leadberboard\\nPersona: At huggingface\\nFriend: ncie thx\\nFriend: Tuesday 8 AM he invited for a meeting\\nPersona: perfect\\nPersona: I added some guys in the docs from SI\\nFriend: I sent to chriatianr\\nFriend: lovely\\nFriend: we do the template first, or targeted?\\nPersona: Was thinking template w/o idea 3 for all of them. What do u think about that?\\nFriend: ok wait, I'll review them\\nFriend: why not idea 3?\\nFriend: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\\nPersona: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\\nPersona: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\\nFriend: ok I am checking them rn\\nFriend: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\\nFriend: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\\nFriend: I had one chance and I took it\\nPersona: Don't stress it\\nFriend: i think i agree with you\\nFriend: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\\nFriend: Except for Toke and Marion I think\\nFriend: I wrote in green\\nFriend: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\\nPersona: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\\nFriend: with ideas, like you wrote?\\nFriend: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\\nPersona: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nPersona: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nPersona: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nFriend: So will skip him\\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc? I believe I tagged u"

It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\\nFriend: its much more relax\\nPersona: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\\nPersona: What is it?\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: how was it?\\nPersona: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\\nFriend: ai chat\\nPersona: Hilarious!

Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan\\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\\nFriend: ohh ur going today\\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Thx\ud83d\ude05\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: U better up your game cuz\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: omg not me\\nFriend: Ava can do that for SURE\\nFriend: I can barely play twinkle twinkle little star by ear\ud83d\ude2d\\nPersona: That\u2019s not bad hahahah\\nFriend: Y DO U ALWAYS FIND THAT\\nPersona: Hhahahaha\\nPersona: Did i send u this before?\\nPersona: We expect 2 be in/around Vancouver 31st July-1st august -ish\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: Anazing :)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll be able to spend time with you on July 31st :) but Monday I have work from 8am-7pm\\nPersona: Or timetable is not that firm, so we\u2019ll update u in the meantime\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a okay!!\\nFriend: Monday - Friday (8am-5) I\u2019m generally working.\\nPersona: U In LA tmr?\\nFriend: haiii c: ya I am but only till Sunday because I have work\\nFriend: R u gonna be here\\nPersona: Gonna be there from tmr at 12-13 ish\\nFriend: Is that it???\\nFriend: One day????\\nPersona: Noo, I\u2019ll arrive tmr.

Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\\nFriend: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\\nFriend: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\\nPersona: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\\nFriend: Ahhh sad\\nPersona: But I got tile managers ofc\\nFriend: Alright, thats good :D\\nPersona: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\\nFriend: 1337x\\nFriend: Is currently the best\\nFriend: 1337x.to\\nFriend: I see you have discovered chatgpt\\nFriend: I use it for studying a bunch\\nFriend: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\\nPersona: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\\nFriend: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\\nFriend: its much more relax\\nPersona: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\\nPersona: What is it?\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: how was it?\\nPersona: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\\nFriend: ai chat\\nPersona: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\\nPersona: They loved it!\\nFriend: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: :Ddddd\\nFriend: you must try character.ai\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts. The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry! Ive been running late 4 everything today, incl my scuba diving class I just came home from, so I forgot our call... Would u mind calling Saturday instead?\ud83d\ude05\\nFriend: Now worries, I had some lovely sleep instead ahahaha\\nFriend: What about Sunday?\\nPersona: Cool!

What game r u into?\\nPersona: I think Saturday 11 is best 4 me:)\\nPersona: U up?:)\\nFriend: up \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Rimworld \ud83d\udc40\\nPersona: Cool I'm headed home.

I've said yes 2 go see a christmas market thing, so would it be cool w/ u if we make it a 1h-long meeting max?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Obedience to Authority\\nFriend: what happened?\\nFriend: Been using Mac for a while now and at work I like it. One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\\nFriend: For example these lines, specifically only triggered when Adobe Acrobat is open saved me so much hassle\\nFriend: Adobe acrobat is very limited in key remappings, so with Autohotkey I can bypass that. Also the annoying copy paste behavior where it adds line breaks is annoying as hell, so this fixes it\\nFriend: Most of then I used for Mindmanager\\nFriend: But I have already made some for Logseq. Already quite a lot I had to make a hotkey to show available hotkeys\\nFriend: Perhaps you know anything similar on MacOS?\\nFriend: This is quite ridiculous\\nPersona: I use better touch tool (if u have the touchbar this is by far the best), but I heard keyboard maestro should be nice as well\\nPersona: Lmao\\nPersona: Lmk if it solves anything 4 u:)\\nPersona: What is .ahk? Which language is that?\\nFriend: Autohotkey\\nFriend: But its only for windows\\nFriend: I will try these you sent me\\nFriend: But by the name it sounds like its limited to trackpad or mouse\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I\u2019ve send them your info, now it\u2019s in their ballpark if they\u2019ll contact u;)\\nFriend: Transformation and Innovation Management is my specialisation \ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: Hahah, it\u2019s called Sustainability Management \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: I might have a small job 4 u. What\u2019s your masters called again? I sold u as a csr transformation consultant:)\\nFriend: Wtf, I could\u2019ve sworn that I didn\u2019t take it with me\\nFriend: I guess that\u2019s fair\ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Everything is good:) sounds good 4 me. Go hard on your vacation!;)\\nFriend: c\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcs, boy! You need to go vegetarian for at least one week as a penalty. I'll call a friend and ask if he could take care of it. Alisa got sick unfortunately\\nFriend: Hej hej, hope everything's fine back in CPH :) Unfortunately, I won't have time today to call. \ud83d\ude0c Maybe next week?

Maybe someone else will come and stay there\u2026\\nFriend: Naaah!\\nFriend: Nvm, I found it\\nFriend: I\u2019ll see if I can do it before I leave:)\\nFriend: Not even put them in the washer, without starting it?\\nFriend: On top of your mailbox or in your apartment? Don\u2019t u have 1 more key 2 the apartment?\\nFriend: First thing first. What is the snoppy italian called again? I\u2019ll save it 2 my maps this time\\nFriend: And water the plants. The \u201ethirsty\u201c parts are pretty sure dead parts. It happens to plants from time to time.they loose leaves. You could take them off, if you feel like. That could help them :)\\nFriend: The next guest or Phil can just wash them\\nFriend: You can leave the sheets on\\nFriend: Hahahaha, watched the videos\\nFriend: Hmhmhm, you can leave them in our mailbox and the key for the mailbox on top of it \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Ah Alisa was texting me: u leaving at 4 tmrw morning\\nFriend: It\u2019s Paul-Robeson-Stra\u00dfe 36.

It\u2019s ridiculously powerful!\\nFriend: I found the vacuum\\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll just keep on using the scooters\\nFriend: I\u2018m sorry\\nFriend: Unfortunately it\u2019s in Phil\u2019s office backyard \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Can I borrow your bike?:)\\nFriend: I don\u2019t really understand tbh\\nFriend: But yeah, defining the loops is a good idea\\nFriend: No, it was ridiculously unstructured as always\\nFriend: Do you get feedback for papers? This way, you could at least have feedback for the next paper/re-exam :)\\nFriend: I see, the analysis is always the hardest, I\u2019d say. \ud83d\ude0c but maybe you don\u2019t have to be so \u201econcrete\u201c? Maybe you can argue for whatever point you wanna make, with sources you already have?\\nFriend: Hm, maybe you have to think of different steps and loops you have to take to finish an essay/paper. Did you work with a writing plan?\\nFriend: I wish I could learn how 2 convert my time-mgmt mistakes 2 \u201crules\u201d 4 myself the next time, but it always seem 2 be completely new:(\\nFriend: I do\\nFriend: Already at the smoothie place tho. It\u2019s good!\\nFriend: I\u2019d rather Hand in at the re-exam (it\u2019s the same assignment) than 2 hand in smth I\u2019m not proud of. The conclusion paragraph won\u2019t be hard, it\u2019s the analysis stuff that bugs me - 2 find citations from old academics on a future topic\\nFriend: It\u2019s one of your first papers. I think, you don\u2019t have to be perfect. You can see it as a first trial, no? :) and in any case you learned a lot for the next time regarding time management and structuring stuff. :)\\nFriend: Do you have grammarly or a similar Programm? I think, it would help to let it run through something like this? :) just to have some quick fixes \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: Also if you want to safe some time, you can also just go to Caf\u00e9 Kraft to work from there. Therefore, you don\u2019t have to commute.\\nFriend: Hi there \u2600\ufe0f \\nFriend: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll make it:/\\nFriend: 5.

What do u think about that?\\nFriend: ok wait, I'll review them\\nFriend: why not idea 3?\\nFriend: cause maybe some are too good to leave out idea 3\\nPersona: Which would u not mind leaving out idea 3 for?\\nPersona: And do u think these 10 all should get a mail from us soon?:)\\nFriend: ok I am checking them rn\\nFriend: sorry was getting food and then had to do the laundry\\nFriend: I have occupied all 4 of the washers in the dorm \ud83d\ude08\\nFriend: I had one chance and I took it\\nPersona: Don't stress it\\nFriend: i think i agree with you\\nFriend: I didn't think all of them would be so irrelevant for idea 3\\nFriend: Except for Toke and Marion I think\\nFriend: I wrote in green\\nFriend: I will write follow ups to Mads and Mathias now\\nPersona: I'll send default template to everyone, except for Toke and Marion then\\nFriend: with ideas, like you wrote?\\nFriend: so mostly for idea 1 and for some few idea 2?\\nPersona: Yeah. I accidentally sent 1 and 2 to Nathan\\nPersona: Should we send only a single to some (matching the list I made in docs)?\\nPersona: We also need 2 change the template if we only present 1 idea... R we not supposed 2 make them low effort?\\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command. Do u think it's silly 2 assume they might take a weekend meeting (in the end paragraph: \"Would you be available for a meeting this \u2013 or early next \u2013 week to talk about how we can develop one of our directions into a concrete thesis topic?\")\\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\\nFriend: I don't this its silly to assume, but perhaps it may come up as direspectful. But you know Danish culture more.\\nFriend: I don't think its silly to assume*\\nFriend: I sent quite targeted follow ups to Christiane and Mads, I think they are very good for idea 3\\nFriend: Actually I dont know what to say to Mathias, he might not be that good.\\nFriend: So will skip him\\nPersona: I meant if its fine if i add topic 1 and 2 for all of Them? Otherwise i need 2 modify the template (and I\u2019m a bit time pressured rn)\\nFriend: Dont add topic 2\\nFriend: for all\\nFriend: Topic 1 is mostly relevant\\nFriend: more targeted will get better response rates\\nFriend: cause platforms look irrelevant for most of them\\nPersona: Ok I\u2019ll follow the list, and your green comments\\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\\nFriend: no worries maan"

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Not ready yet?\\nFriend: nice :)\\nFriend: but you can also just call when you have time. will be in the cafe working\\nFriend: hmhm, I'm leaving in 5min here\\nFriend: We r biking the next 20m\\nFriend: maybe in 1.5 hours? :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m just about to get up.
