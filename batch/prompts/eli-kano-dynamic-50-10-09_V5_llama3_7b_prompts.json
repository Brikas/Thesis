My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: SP201\\nFriend: but idk, if you can still get it\\nFriend: did you try assembling?\\nPersona: I did, I\u2019ll let u c when I get home\\nPersona: I don\u2019t think I should come by, since I\u2019m sort of sick\\nFriend: ahh of course\\nPersona: Did u attend all of the KLC classes? I only went 2 half of them\\nPersona: If yes, do u have notes from sessions/lectures: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9 that you'd like 2 share?:) I have the rest in markdown or pdf\\nFriend: yeah will send in a bit\\nFriend: thats my whole mmap\\nFriend: feels good to send note to some1 without haveing to explain wtf I just sent\\nFriend: notes*\\nPersona: I know what u mean!\\nPersona: I saw u didn't have notes from L5, where I was in class\\nFriend: thanks man\\nPersona: ofc:)\\nFriend: I missed this case\\nFriend: will be interesting to read\\nFriend: Elias, you @ egment now?\\nPersona: No. Im at a camp on fyn\\nFriend: ahhh okay\\nFriend: have fun\\nPersona: Thx! What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Mindmapping in VR\\nPersona: Yes yes yes and yes\\nPersona: ^Easy mindmap to anki conversion\\nPersona: Btw, do u have 30 min too help me with a minor machine learning problem at some point? (Preferably before noon tmr if possible):)\\nFriend: Hmm maybe\\nFriend: Whats the problem? I dont have time for a meet neither today nor tommorow as I am.working. But on Thursday I am free\\nFriend: Unless its smth quick\\nPersona: It falls under the category of parameter tuning and prediction (don\u2019t know how quick that is). What time will suit u best Thursday?\\nFriend: Maybe around afternoon 11 or 13?\\nPersona: I can do 11:)\\nFriend: Alright\\nPersona: I\u2019ll find a spot in kilen\\nPersona: No free tables. I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas\\nFriend: Yoo\\nFriend: I thouht we just call \ud83d\ude06\\nPersona: Oh hahah\\nPersona: I\u2019ll just call u from here then\\nFriend: im turning on my pc\\nFriend: google meets?\\nFriend: Cant hear you\\nPersona: Where r we meeting?\\nFriend: Oh fuck.we had a meeting today??\\nFriend: I literally forgot to put on my calendar\\nFriend: where were we supposed to meet?\\nFriend: when*\\nPersona: No worries, I overslept 2\\nPersona: Also I accidentally put it at 12 instead of 10, idk why\\nPersona: Wanna move it 2 this afternoon, if u have time?\\nFriend: Would it be a problem meeting on Thursday?\\nPersona: That\u2019s cool\\nPersona: 10 at sp?\\nFriend: Okay, I make note!\\nPersona: I\u2019ve updated the drive-folder I share with you\\nPersona: Can I get access 2 this map?\\nFriend: Its empty almost\\nFriend: but yeah, send me your email\\nPersona: Eliastorjani@gmail.com\\nFriend: I shared with you\\nFriend: Have you found if Aspiri thing can be shared?\\nPersona: Unfortunately not. It has 2-factor authentication\\nPersona: I\u2019ll buy it tonight, and grind the next few days\\nFriend: What kind of content there is?\\nFriend: Using any 3rd party app as the 2-nd factor or what?\\nPersona: SMS code\\nFriend: If we can find a way to share it then we can split\\nFriend: hm, do you know if there is another way?\\nPersona: It\u2019s our course specifically, is a dense/summarized version, thought by a 3rd party private firm\\nFriend: Like an email? We can set auto-forward\\nPersona: Idk yet, I\u2019ll let u know when I purchase\\nFriend: Also we can autoforward sms"

Got 7*no, and I think we should send followups to Karol, Mads, Tawfiq, Timothy, and GG (each from the opposite account as the one where we send the original mail), what do u think?\\nFriend: 7no's :o\\nFriend: from how many outreaches?\\nPersona: When we submit a proposal we have 2 fill out the supervisor field.

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing!

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing!

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing!

What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair.

I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom.

DH.C.211\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\\nFriend: What are PP's?\\nFriend: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\\nFriend: is it anki cards?\\nPersona: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\\nPersona: no, just from class\\nPersona: So u can command-f\\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I see you are enjoying the monkeys\\nPersona: Yeah They where sweet, except when they stole my moms sandwich\\nFriend: Did you pet them?\\nPersona: No actually not, my parents said it was a bad idea\\nPersona: Any news about Bella sky or guldsmeden?\\nFriend: I will need your cv\\nPersona: I Will send it to u now\\nFriend: I will send it to her. She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends"

The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Where do I find that\\nPersona: It\u2019s your phone number\\nFriend: 53809977\\nPersona: It says no account has that number\\nFriend: 53809967\\nFriend: That\u2019s the correct number\\nFriend: could u send me the books\\nPersona: Sure.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\\nFriend: What are PP's?\\nFriend: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\\nPersona: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\\nFriend: is it anki cards?\\nPersona: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\\nPersona: no, just from class\\nPersona: So u can command-f\\nFriend: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\\nFriend: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\\nFriend: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\\nPersona: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\\nFriend: Are you in the classs? :d\\nPersona: 2 your left\\nFriend: \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: finally mindmaps got some attention\\nPersona: Nice that cbs bought the license!\\nPersona: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\\nPersona: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\\nFriend: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Got time until 13;)\\nFriend: Oh nooooo, I forgot about yesterday. Do you have time today? :)\\nFriend: 15 would be too tight. I'm sorry!\\nFriend: 15 would be ideal. But 17 is ok if u can\u2019t 15\\nFriend: 17hish?\\nFriend: What time?\\nFriend: workin right now. how about this afternoon?\\nFriend: Wanna talk?\\nFriend: That\u2019s also a risky move!

Can u plz talk 2 him? I think he\u2019s feeling lonely since everybody defaults 2 their mother tongue, and everyone but him got an exclusive language - as well as established lives already in the city. I think u have been the best example I\u2019ve seen of establishing contact in a place similar 2 Sam\u2019s situation. Sry 4 ranting. I can\u2019t help but being upset on his behalf, and I feel a little responsible bc I encouraged him 2 seek a project\\nFriend: That\u2019s fair. I understand\\nFriend: I think so :) wanted to show Nuh the city and spend some \u201cromantic\u201d time as I\u2019m at my German parents right now for some more days, having a lot of viewings with my dad and cannot see Nuh. \ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Maaaan, I got super sick again.

I\u2019m free both Friday and Saturday (class ends 16 Friday)\\nFriend: Or Saturday night? \u263a\ufe0f\\nFriend: Are you free Friday night? :)\\nFriend: But I could imagine us sleeping in and heading to the train in a rush tbh \u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: What time ish? Bc they eat super early, and I wanna move it 2 dinner if u leave at noon for example\\nFriend: I think early already \ud83e\udee3\\nFriend: Short: Very much!

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Did the new girl arrive??\\nPersona: No she\u2019s coming tmr\\nFriend: Ohh true\\nFriend: I love this placee\\nFriend: Go to the skapto para\\nPersona: What is the slapto para?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search.

Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\\nPersona: U need help?\\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\\nPersona: Cute\\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Love this video\\nPersona: Me2\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\\nPersona: Thank you:)!\\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\\nFriend: So cute!!!!\\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Okay\\nFriend: do you still want to go to necus\\nFriend: nexus\\nPersona: Yes\\nFriend: Okay when should we go\\nFriend: I\u2019m down just let me know when\\nPersona: Sry bro, I feel 2 exhausted 2 party\\nFriend: Okay I get it see you tomo\\nFriend: What are you doing tonight\\nPersona: A birthday pub crawl with primary school guys\\nPersona: Wbu?\\nFriend: Ahhh okay sounds fun\\nFriend: Not sure yet\\nPersona: Go 4 the rave:P\\nFriend: Hahahah\\nPersona: Can I bring my friend Bastian? Him and Alfred r childhood friends:)\\nFriend: Ywah\\nFriend: Of course\\nFriend: Let me know when your here\\nPersona: We r at Kongens Nytorv\\nFriend: Go to norreport\\nPersona: We know\\nFriend: Ahh okay\\nFriend: Wya\\nFriend: Oh let\u2019s go my boy\\nPersona: From my friend hahah\\nFriend: Hahahha\\nFriend: Damn\\nPersona: How was Yesterday\\nFriend: Good\\nFriend: How about you\\nPersona: Pretty mit\\nPersona: Lig\\nPersona: Kit\\nFriend: Hahaha\\nPersona: Lit*\\nFriend: Seems like it\\nPersona: Hahahah\\nFriend: You get with any girls\\nPersona: Yeah, i knew her already tho\\nPersona: Wbu?\\nFriend: Ahh no\\nFriend: But I didn\u2019t really try\\nFriend: I was very drunk\\nPersona: U where the perfect condition\\nPersona: Did u go 2 school?\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: I wasn\u2019t feeling it\\nPersona: Understandable\\nPersona: You called Christian."

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me.

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends"

The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: SP201\\nFriend: but idk, if you can still get it\\nFriend: did you try assembling?\\nPersona: I did, I\u2019ll let u c when I get home\\nPersona: I don\u2019t think I should come by, since I\u2019m sort of sick\\nFriend: ahh of course\\nPersona: Did u attend all of the KLC classes? I only went 2 half of them\\nPersona: If yes, do u have notes from sessions/lectures: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9 that you'd like 2 share?:) I have the rest in markdown or pdf\\nFriend: yeah will send in a bit\\nFriend: thats my whole mmap\\nFriend: feels good to send note to some1 without haveing to explain wtf I just sent\\nFriend: notes*\\nPersona: I know what u mean!\\nPersona: I saw u didn't have notes from L5, where I was in class\\nFriend: thanks man\\nPersona: ofc:)\\nFriend: I missed this case\\nFriend: will be interesting to read\\nFriend: Elias, you @ egment now?\\nPersona: No. Im at a camp on fyn\\nFriend: ahhh okay\\nFriend: have fun\\nPersona: Thx! What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\\nPersona: U need help?\\nFriend: Ahahaha I actually thought about you while I did it\\nPersona: Cute\\nFriend: Ehehe \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: Plovdivvvvv \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\\nPersona: U know it\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: Aaaaaaaaaa omg\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Love this video\\nPersona: Me2\\nFriend: \ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\ud83e\udd70\\nFriend: Have a Nice trip home!!\\nFriend: Ahahahahahahahah\\nPersona: Thank you:)!\\nFriend: \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: Remember i told u about these?\\nFriend: Ahhhhh omg!!!!\\nFriend: So cute!!!!\\nFriend: Remember also about the recipe I told you of the bread and weird meat and blood??

Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back!

The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into.

I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hey, have you tried mindjet manager already?\\nPersona: I gave it a quick shot here\\nPersona: How r u sharing files? mail?\\nPersona: Until I get used 2 it, I still only use it 4 post class notes.

I've said yes 2 go see a christmas market thing, so would it be cool w/ u if we make it a 1h-long meeting max?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Obedience to Authority\\nFriend: what happened?\\nFriend: Been using Mac for a while now and at work I like it. One thing that I have not found how to substitude from what I was used to on Windows is third-party software that allows endless behavior change of all keyboard and mouse inputs. \n\nIn mac, the out of the box keybaord shortcut solution is pretty good. Windows has nothing. But Windows has a third party tool called AutoHotkey, which was there for very long and allows to script the behavior of any input, with some very advanced logic.\n\nBeen using it for prob more than 3-4 years and my script that runs all the time on my pc has accumulated over 1000 lines from various small improvements\\nFriend: For example these lines, specifically only triggered when Adobe Acrobat is open saved me so much hassle\\nFriend: Adobe acrobat is very limited in key remappings, so with Autohotkey I can bypass that. Also the annoying copy paste behavior where it adds line breaks is annoying as hell, so this fixes it\\nFriend: Most of then I used for Mindmanager\\nFriend: But I have already made some for Logseq. Already quite a lot I had to make a hotkey to show available hotkeys\\nFriend: Perhaps you know anything similar on MacOS?\\nFriend: This is quite ridiculous\\nPersona: I use better touch tool (if u have the touchbar this is by far the best), but I heard keyboard maestro should be nice as well\\nPersona: Lmao\\nPersona: Lmk if it solves anything 4 u:)\\nPersona: What is .ahk? Which language is that?\\nFriend: Autohotkey\\nFriend: But its only for windows\\nFriend: I will try these you sent me\\nFriend: But by the name it sounds like its limited to trackpad or mouse\\nPersona: I think its able to modify all input interfaces\\nFriend: oh, in that case I shall try it\\nPersona: Yeah better touch tool is actually the only 1 I recommend all the way\\nFriend: This prompt works pretty well.\\nFriend: I just copy paste some info from the top of the document that looks relevant\\nFriend: Spews me out a bibliography entry and an in text citation\\nPersona: Don't u use a reference manager?\\nPersona: I've been busy w/ exams. Do u feel like catching up soon and contact potential supervisors?:)\\nFriend: hey me too\\nFriend: can we catch up after new year?\\nPersona: Sounds good!\\nFriend: What is your timezone, my fella?\\nFriend: Back in Denmark?\\nPersona: Ill be back the 5th;)\\nFriend: Hey, should we call up tommorow?\\nFriend: And welcome back!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\\nFriend: read the yellow parts'ishg\\nFriend: literally 100% what we were talking about\\nPersona: U did it again!\\nPersona: U r pretty good at finding the exact paper we need\\nFriend: I'll read briefly this one tonight, see where it links, also maybe look around other scholarly papers on this key term\\nPersona: I'm gonna focus on his literature. But I'll wake up early instead (my sleep rhythm got me waking up 6 naturally\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: 6 is a good time, true A person\\nFriend: Btw\\nFriend: but thats a decade ago\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Ofc np! Hope u enjoy the date;)\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: Are u at Egmont?\\nPersona: Amager. At a shelter\\nFriend: Whats happening there? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: A sort of goodby event before I go on exchange:)\\nFriend: Okay nice, thanks for the invite!\\nPersona: Ofc. I hope u can come!\ud83d\ude09\\nFriend: Hey, when and where are we meeting tmmrow?\\nPersona: At my my parents backyard (address at event) at 15.00;)\\nFriend: alriiiight\\nFriend: see you then\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nPersona: You called Airidas.\\nFriend: Hey man, are you already on the opposite side of earth? \ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Yeah, and I\u2019m currently in the tiniest hostel bed of Shanghai!\\nPersona: It\u2019s a nice city tho\ud83d\ude43\\nFriend: ahaha the Shanghai experience\\nFriend: when does your classes start?+\\nPersona: We just started intro, so I believe in 2 weeks:)\\nFriend: Uu into week, make sure to make a lot of frienda there, then you can travel back to asia cheaper haha\\nFriend: Did you pick difficult subjects? Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)"

I only went 2 half of them\\nPersona: If yes, do u have notes from sessions/lectures: 1, 2, 6, 7, 9 that you'd like 2 share?:) I have the rest in markdown or pdf\\nFriend: yeah will send in a bit\\nFriend: thats my whole mmap\\nFriend: feels good to send note to some1 without haveing to explain wtf I just sent\\nFriend: notes*\\nPersona: I know what u mean!\\nPersona: I saw u didn't have notes from L5, where I was in class\\nFriend: thanks man\\nPersona: ofc:)\\nFriend: I missed this case\\nFriend: will be interesting to read\\nFriend: Elias, you @ egment now?\\nPersona: No. Im at a camp on fyn\\nFriend: ahhh okay\\nFriend: have fun\\nPersona: Thx! What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: we can investigate if u have time\\nPersona: Cool. I\u2019m out 4 some food rn. Maybe when I\u2019m back\\nPersona: Will u send me the pic u took 4 me yesterday?\\nPersona: Im back:)\\nFriend: I am at the library but I am so lazy to get up xdd\\nFriend: yh lol I see myself in the pic\\nFriend: Hey, how was Econ? :D\\nFriend: Did you know that you can search all of the linked maps at the same time?\\nFriend: This is an amazing feature\\nPersona: I blanked..:/\\nPersona: My document crashed, and I only saved very early.

I've been thinking a lot about how we will present a certain product 2 the digital personas, and I feel like it's going to be challenging 2 not embed bias. Do u have any idea about that?\\nPersona: Why is it it's called WIP?\\nPersona: I'll share my notes. Hope u feel better soon!<3\\nPersona: git config --global alias.cp '!git add . && git commit -m \"Quick update\" && git push'\\nPersona: git config --global alias.up 'pull origin main'\\nPersona: Here is 2 alias scripts. Put them into your terminal. So u from now on only need 2 \"cd\" into your local version of the repo, and then write \"git cp\" to share yours, and \"git up\" to get mine;)\\nFriend: well, a persona must be biast by definition I would assume\\nFriend: if you are 0 biast, then you are just a general person, not really a persona\\nFriend: Or what kind of bias did you mean?\\nFriend: oh, I mean work in progres, I tend to use that a lot haha\\nPersona: I see your points, but I meant of how \"we\" present the product to the personas. I think we'll learn a lot from talking 2 a focus group facilitator!\\nPersona: I updated my repo. lmk if it works\\nFriend: fuck I went to sp\\nPersona: I forgot time and place.

It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\\nPersona: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\\nFriend: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\\nFriend: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\\nFriend: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\\nFriend: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\\nPersona: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\\nFriend: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\\nPersona: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\\nPersona: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\\nPersona: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\\nFriend: hm I see you have an intersting structure\\nFriend: Never thought of that\\nFriend: Is that working well for you?\\nFriend: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\\nFriend: but I am sure you got used to it\\nFriend: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\\nFriend: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\\nFriend: I should try it sometime\\nFriend: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\\nFriend: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\\nFriend: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\\nFriend: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\\nPersona: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\\nPersona: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\\nPersona: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\\nPersona: I\u2019ll check it out!\\nPersona: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\\nFriend: Idk if there is for mac\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Did the new girl arrive??\\nPersona: No she\u2019s coming tmr\\nFriend: Ohh true\\nFriend: I love this placee\\nFriend: Go to the skapto para\\nPersona: What is the slapto para? I googled it\\nFriend: It's a restaurant\\nFriend: The best burger place ever\\nPersona: Okayyyyy!\\nPersona: I guess I\u2019ll need 2 try it tomorrow\\nFriend: Do itt\\nFriend: They have the best vegetarian burger\\nFriend: And lot of game\\nPersona: I might get the veggie, just because I had a normal burger earlier today\\nFriend: The new Georgian girl is in Plovdiv rn hahahah\\nPersona: What game?\\nPersona: What?\\nFriend: Catan, Uno\\nFriend: And etc\\nPersona: Oh these kind of games, i see\\nPersona: At a birthday party huh?\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: Boo\\nFriend: Just a party\\nFriend: Hahaha\\nPersona: It said happy birthday tho?\\nFriend: When\\nPersona: In your video when u filmed around\\nFriend: Idk hahaha\\nFriend: We are drunk\\nFriend: I don\u2019t remember anymore\\nPersona: Hahahaha\\nPersona: We went 2 the burger place yesterday, and it was amazing!\\nPersona: Also, we've met Fira and she is adorable\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: Yayyyy\\nFriend: Happy to hear thesee\\nFriend: Enjoy baby\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: Yass\\nPersona: We r also watching Eurovision\\nFriend: Did u votee??\\nPersona: No. Did u?\\nFriend: Yes ofc\\nFriend: That's why I'm watchinn\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nPersona: Who tho?\\nFriend: Malta\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: Are you leaving tomorrw?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: Noooo\\nPersona: Hahhahahaa\\nFriend: Yeah next time I\u2019ll just go brown again\\nFriend: But it gets tiring\\nFriend: It\u2019s always the same my hairs doesn\u2019t change\\nPersona: U don\u2019t look like the evil lady lol\\nPersona: Just googled her\\nFriend: Ahahahahah\\nFriend: Thank you!\\nPersona: Get your Afro back!\\nFriend: Neveeeeet\\nPersona: Or really long\\nFriend: Maybe yeas\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: Miss uuuu\\nPersona: Miss u 2!\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Love it\\nFriend: Aaaaah so cute omg!!!!\\nFriend: What happened???\\nPersona: I blackouted and hit my head yesterday\\nFriend: Oh Nikki\\nFriend: Noooo * wtf ahahaha\\nFriend: But is it serious?\\nPersona: It\u2019s okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s really nice\\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy"

Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished\\nPersona: Oh wow, what was wrong w/ it?\\nPersona: I'm home now and ready btw:)\\nFriend: The video chat ended.\\nPersona: autogen microsoft\\nPersona: OSINT\\nPersona: Today is not so good 4 me. Could u do Monday instead?\\nFriend: yeah man, sure\\nPersona: I didn't really consider that my brother is leaving in 2 days... Is thursday still a good day 4 u?\\nFriend: No worries man, what about Friday? Thursday I am working during DK daytime\\nPersona: Im free from 10-ish dk time friday:)\\nFriend: cool, sounds good\\nFriend: btw mate, do you know any\nA tool that allows to create a somewhat of a digital close of oneself using text description (maybe direct points, but perhaps diary entries, CV docs, any text potentially) and then being able to have a conversational agent (such as GPT4) able to have you as the context, for various questions, such as \"What could I be interesting in learning from this article?\"\\nFriend: clone*\\nPersona: Saw smth similar on r/localllama.

Do you think the studies will be difficult?\\nPersona: All of the Chinese people r super helpful and sweet. I\u2019m already sure I\u2019ll come back! Let me know if u wanna find time 2 come and see Shanghai while I\u2019m here:)\\nPersona: Ill only know after the 16th. The final round 2 get classes starts the 4th of September:/ But I\u2019m still considering if I wanna pick advanced micro-Econ, bc they r pretty intense w school here\\nFriend: micro econ in Asia\\nFriend: is probably hard like in the movies hahaha\\nFriend: Are thinking of using Obsidian for notes?\\nPersona: Exactly! And most people say the stereotype is true\\nFriend: Hey, I actually ended up using all three note-taking methods at the same time.\nFor old subjects and old non-school topics - MindManager\nFor one course, personal reflection/strategy - Obsidian\nFor the three other courses, work and new non-school topics - Logseq\\nFriend: So I am testing out three at the same time and comparing them in my mind.\\nFriend: And for Logseq and Obsidian I am also using different approaches. I split things into a lot more files in Obsidian than in Logseq. In Logseq I mostly keep whole subject in one file and then just create interlinking in the same file.\\nFriend: Both seem to have its own pluses and minuses.\\nPersona: Let me give u a list of the plugins I use in Obsidian, then u might be more inclined 2 my method (or I'll learn something from u, if u don't like it). I think I've been optimizing quite a bit, and the whole hyperlink within the same file is imo easily solved with a table of content \u2013 or if u want a very specific section, also hyperlinking\\nPersona: Btw, I heard I'm a bit late in looking 4 someone 2 write my thesis with, and u r the 1st person that comes 2 my mind. What's your plan? I was wondering if u wanna write together w/ me, if we can find common ground on topic:)\\nFriend: I am sold. What are these plugins?\\nFriend: Gooosh, is it thesis time already \ud83d\ude28\\nFriend: I dont really have a plan yet, I need to look up the possible topic areas\\nFriend: I will think about it this week\\nFriend: I know for sure that if I write it with some, we need to be really aligned on the topic and expectations\\nFriend: what kind of topics interest you?\\nPersona: Let me get back 2 u with the plugins, and a proper answer on the topics tmr. I\u2019m exhausted after a long day in Disneyland rn\\nFriend: Oh nice Disneyland\\nFriend: and for sure, have a nice rest man\\nPersona: Are the topic areas predefined?\\nPersona: _Thesis alignment_\nInitially I thought my TST assignment would be a headstart to my bachelor project. An attempt to make hermeneutic topics approachable from more rigid lenses. Looking into how covert influence (PSYOPs) can be amplified via data-driven augmentation; like semantic derived psychographics, big data simulation, network-logics, etc. However, I feel like I kind of pivoted due to a too hermeneutic and policalized nature of this topic \u2013 I think it's difficult to capture a holistic depiction of the subject imo. So I'd actually rather hear what you've been considering (if anything)? Perhaps you could tell me what classes that you've considered most interesting to pursue deep research within, or what you exactly mean regarding expectations.\n\n\u25cf It's easier for me to say what I'm less interested about this early. I can already say for sure I'm not interested in: RGDB, MCMR, and Accounting.\n\u25cf The rest I'm not immediately thinking of, while still open to approach. Right now I'm btw taking classes in psychology, strategy, and Chinese entrepreneurship.\nWhat exam you wrote, or subjects you've studied, are you thinking about mostly after you've finished the class? Mine are probably MIO, game theory and financial methodology applied outside their \"original\" domains, DTDDB/BDA, and all of our classes in 4S (as well as the classes I take now in 5S).\\nPersona: _Tbf, I could prob boil the essentials down to_\n\n1. Advanced tables\n2. Commander\n3. Floating toc\n4. Heading shifter\n5. Linter\n6. Md formatting assistant\n7. Natural language dates\n8. Paste URL into selection\n9. QuickAdd\n10. Settings Search\n11. Smarter Markdown Hotkeys\n12. Style Settings\nAnd the I also recommend the shimmering focus theme, as well as plugin groups (which also technically is a plugin)\\nPersona: DB folder and dataview are the next plugins I\u2019ll adopt btw\\nPersona: I\u2019d like 2 add that I was actually thinking about Kimia as well as u (I haven\u2019t asked her tho). I have the feeling that u sparkle my curiosity in more unique research, whereas I know her structure is complementary 2 my less linear approach. That\u2019s why I write 2 u as the 1st person. Because I think we could find common ground in topics I\u2019d rather dive into. Do u get me?\\nPersona: I\u2019m not sure if I should interpret on your silence, so here is a reminder;)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Did the new girl arrive??\\nPersona: No she\u2019s coming tmr\\nFriend: Ohh true\\nFriend: I love this placee\\nFriend: Go to the skapto para\\nPersona: What is the slapto para?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Where do I find that\\nPersona: It\u2019s your phone number\\nFriend: 53809977\\nPersona: It says no account has that number\\nFriend: 53809967\\nFriend: That\u2019s the correct number\\nFriend: could u send me the books\\nPersona: Sure.
