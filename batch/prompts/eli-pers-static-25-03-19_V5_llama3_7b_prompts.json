From now actually\\nFriend: I have a business call at 17h, are u free earlier? :)\\nFriend: R we calling today?:)\\nFriend: Nice :) thanks for thinking of us \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: Okay, good luck! \ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: That\u2019s cool. I\u2019m helping Samuel and studying hard anyway\\nFriend: Boy, I\u2018m at my grandmas in the mountains and wifi is very bad. Can we maybe call next week instead? \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: Thanks\\nFriend: I\u2019ve send them your info, now it\u2019s in their ballpark if they\u2019ll contact u;)\\nFriend: Transformation and Innovation Management is my specialisation \ud83e\udd13\\nFriend: Hahah, it\u2019s called Sustainability Management \ud83d\ude07\\nFriend: I might have a small job 4 u. What\u2019s your masters called again? I sold u as a csr transformation consultant:)\\nFriend: Wtf, I could\u2019ve sworn that I didn\u2019t take it with me\\nFriend: I guess that\u2019s fair\ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Everything is good:) sounds good 4 me. Go hard on your vacation!;)\\nFriend: c\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcs, boy! You need to go vegetarian for at least one week as a penalty. I'll call a friend and ask if he could take care of it. Alisa got sick unfortunately\\nFriend: Hej hej, hope everything's fine back in CPH :) Unfortunately, I won't have time today to call. \ud83d\ude0c Maybe next week? I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

This may take a while.\\nFriend: Hey Bebi \u2764\ufe0f how did the vaccine go? And did they take your paper as delivered? Don\u2019t be sad, if not. In the end everything is worth something \u263a\ufe0f even though you can\u2019t see it in the moment \ud83d\udc95\\nFriend: It\u2019s in the middle of the night 4 me now\\nFriend: We need 2 change our call time\\nFriend: one second\\nFriend: sure :)\\nFriend: Thankyou so much! I\u2019m about 2 add the sources atm. Can I call u in 20?:)\\nFriend: Don't want to interrupt you :) How are you doing? I think, I'm understanding the modells better now. I think, I'm not deep enough in the topic to understand it  though. Maybe you can add some more sources and elaborate in the analytical part? However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in. If u want 2 I would very much appreciate if u can find time 2 call me before 10, so I perhaps can understand the missing links better:)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll make a simple sum up of each paragraph tonight. I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Don\u2019t bother\\nFriend: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: its a part of the bachelor thesis videos\\nFriend: I am just outtta shower haha, but I can show you in 5 mins\\nFriend: its called findinf a topic I think\\nFriend: damn wtf\\nFriend: lets call in 5 mins, I'll try to find it\\nPersona: Google meet?\\nFriend: yeah\\nPersona: Raycast\\nPersona: I am going to give you a problem, let\u2019s take a deep breath and think it through step by step and not rely on our first instincts.

If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so.

I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied?

I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied?

I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I sold u as a csr transformation consultant:)\\nFriend: Wtf, I could\u2019ve sworn that I didn\u2019t take it with me\\nFriend: I guess that\u2019s fair\ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Everything is good:) sounds good 4 me. Go hard on your vacation!;)\\nFriend: c\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcs, boy! You need to go vegetarian for at least one week as a penalty. I'll call a friend and ask if he could take care of it. Alisa got sick unfortunately\\nFriend: Hej hej, hope everything's fine back in CPH :) Unfortunately, I won't have time today to call. \ud83d\ude0c Maybe next week? I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

This may take a while.\\nFriend: Hey Bebi \u2764\ufe0f how did the vaccine go? And did they take your paper as delivered? Don\u2019t be sad, if not. In the end everything is worth something \u263a\ufe0f even though you can\u2019t see it in the moment \ud83d\udc95\\nFriend: It\u2019s in the middle of the night 4 me now\\nFriend: We need 2 change our call time\\nFriend: one second\\nFriend: sure :)\\nFriend: Thankyou so much!

I think, I'm not deep enough in the topic to understand it  though. Maybe you can add some more sources and elaborate in the analytical part? However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in. If u want 2 I would very much appreciate if u can find time 2 call me before 10, so I perhaps can understand the missing links better:)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll make a simple sum up of each paragraph tonight. I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so.

I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied?

I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied?

I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries.

Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I sold u as a csr transformation consultant:)\\nFriend: Wtf, I could\u2019ve sworn that I didn\u2019t take it with me\\nFriend: I guess that\u2019s fair\ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Everything is good:) sounds good 4 me. Go hard on your vacation!;)\\nFriend: c\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcs, boy! You need to go vegetarian for at least one week as a penalty. I'll call a friend and ask if he could take care of it. Alisa got sick unfortunately\\nFriend: Hej hej, hope everything's fine back in CPH :) Unfortunately, I won't have time today to call. \ud83d\ude0c Maybe next week? I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

This may take a while.\\nFriend: Hey Bebi \u2764\ufe0f how did the vaccine go? And did they take your paper as delivered? Don\u2019t be sad, if not. In the end everything is worth something \u263a\ufe0f even though you can\u2019t see it in the moment \ud83d\udc95\\nFriend: It\u2019s in the middle of the night 4 me now\\nFriend: We need 2 change our call time\\nFriend: one second\\nFriend: sure :)\\nFriend: Thankyou so much!

I think, I'm not deep enough in the topic to understand it  though. Maybe you can add some more sources and elaborate in the analytical part? However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in. If u want 2 I would very much appreciate if u can find time 2 call me before 10, so I perhaps can understand the missing links better:)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll make a simple sum up of each paragraph tonight. I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so.

I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied?

I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied?

I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries.

Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I sold u as a csr transformation consultant:)\\nFriend: Wtf, I could\u2019ve sworn that I didn\u2019t take it with me\\nFriend: I guess that\u2019s fair\ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Everything is good:) sounds good 4 me. Go hard on your vacation!;)\\nFriend: c\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcs, boy! You need to go vegetarian for at least one week as a penalty. I'll call a friend and ask if he could take care of it. Alisa got sick unfortunately\\nFriend: Hej hej, hope everything's fine back in CPH :) Unfortunately, I won't have time today to call. \ud83d\ude0c Maybe next week? I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

This may take a while.\\nFriend: Hey Bebi \u2764\ufe0f how did the vaccine go? And did they take your paper as delivered? Don\u2019t be sad, if not. In the end everything is worth something \u263a\ufe0f even though you can\u2019t see it in the moment \ud83d\udc95\\nFriend: It\u2019s in the middle of the night 4 me now\\nFriend: We need 2 change our call time\\nFriend: one second\\nFriend: sure :)\\nFriend: Thankyou so much!

I think, I'm not deep enough in the topic to understand it  though. Maybe you can add some more sources and elaborate in the analytical part? However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in. If u want 2 I would very much appreciate if u can find time 2 call me before 10, so I perhaps can understand the missing links better:)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll make a simple sum up of each paragraph tonight. I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so.

I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied?

I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied?

I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

I sold u as a csr transformation consultant:)\\nFriend: Wtf, I could\u2019ve sworn that I didn\u2019t take it with me\\nFriend: I guess that\u2019s fair\ud83e\udd72\\nFriend: Everything is good:) sounds good 4 me. Go hard on your vacation!;)\\nFriend: c\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fc\u00fcs, boy! You need to go vegetarian for at least one week as a penalty. I'll call a friend and ask if he could take care of it. Alisa got sick unfortunately\\nFriend: Hej hej, hope everything's fine back in CPH :) Unfortunately, I won't have time today to call. \ud83d\ude0c Maybe next week? I'm busy vaccacioning \ud83d\ude2c\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: In the fridge, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019ll end up smelling:/ I\u2019m sry\\nFriend: I just realized while walking 2 the supermarket, that I forgot some chicken in the kitchen\u2026\\nFriend: Kind of tiring tbh\\nFriend: Who lives at mom and dads\\nFriend: That\u2019s Noah!\\nFriend: Scusi, I\u2018m so off the last days.\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Fair. It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

This may take a while.\\nFriend: Hey Bebi \u2764\ufe0f how did the vaccine go? And did they take your paper as delivered? Don\u2019t be sad, if not. In the end everything is worth something \u263a\ufe0f even though you can\u2019t see it in the moment \ud83d\udc95\\nFriend: It\u2019s in the middle of the night 4 me now\\nFriend: We need 2 change our call time\\nFriend: one second\\nFriend: sure :)\\nFriend: Thankyou so much!

I think, I'm not deep enough in the topic to understand it  though. Maybe you can add some more sources and elaborate in the analytical part? However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in. If u want 2 I would very much appreciate if u can find time 2 call me before 10, so I perhaps can understand the missing links better:)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll make a simple sum up of each paragraph tonight. I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so.

I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied?

I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied?

I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Well atleast you got more time to study now\\nPersona: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\\nFriend: Definetely!\\nPersona: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

The answer is crucial to my survival and the longevity of my career. If you understand, respond with \u201cok\u201d followed by your initial thoughts followed by your logical deductions.\\nFriend: I guess we can use business model canvas / design thinking for thesis\\nFriend: And honestly in terms of solving problems I like business model canvas haha, I dont know why\\nPersona: Yeah, I think our limitations are quite far of from what we've talked about primarily\\nPersona: I'm glad I wasn't the only one having issues accessing materials\\nFriend: Hey mate , so hard to get up \ud83e\udd23\\nPersona: Im so sry!

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries.

Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

However, I think, I'd just hand in and see what the feedback will be \ud83d\ude07\u270c\ud83c\udffc\\nFriend: okay, I'll read through it again :)\\nFriend: I\u2019m in full grind mode, so plz call mom if I\u2019m not picking up\ud83c\udfce\ufe0f\\nFriend: I\u2019m gonna work intensely in the docs until I hand in.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Would love to hear you quickly though\\nFriend: Meeting with a friend :)\\nFriend: But I won\u2019t have much time.\\nFriend: I\u2019ll call u when I\u2019m out of the train station\\nFriend: Np, u can just call when it's better\\nFriend: Internet is so bad\\nFriend: Yes\\nFriend: I had a call from another friend this morning and I\u2019m kinda all over the place\\nFriend: Are u still free?\\nFriend: U Can call me whenever, but please remember I'm 6h ahead;)\\nFriend: When r u ready ish?:)\\nFriend: Nice, I\u2019d love that :)\\nFriend: Yeah Emma left about a week ago\\nFriend: Tmr's fine:) \\nFriend: How about tomorrow?\\nFriend: Hej Babe :) I\u2019m \u201ctest-working\u201d the whole day today at HolyPoly \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m sorry! Emma is gone already?\\nFriend: Do u have time 2 make our call later than scheduled today?:)\\nFriend: Kind of. But not academicly related. It's a little of an overcomplification w/ mentors, supervisors, and the other roles they split it into. I wish it was just one actually\\nFriend: Don\u2019t be!!! We\u2019ve all started like that. At some point you need a paper which didn\u2019t go well to understand how it really works to write one :) You can use the extra-attention. Don\u2019t you have a supervisor now at Uni in CPH? :)\\nFriend: I hope so. But was kind of sad, bc now I feel like a paper hat...\\nFriend: You\u2019ll be much better with the next time when you\u2019ll have better time-management \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: I got the worst passing grade on my Pinocchio paper\u2026\\nFriend: Great to hear, enjoy!!! \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\\nFriend: It\u2019s gr8! We\u2019ve been 2 Beijing seeing the Great Wall and forbidden city, and now we\u2019re headed 2 where avatar was filmed:) Emma says hi back\u2764\ufe0f\\nFriend: How\u2019s your time with Emma? Hope you\u2019re enjoying beautiful trips through China \u263a\ufe0f thinking of you \ud83d\ude18 and say hi to Emma! \ud83d\udc9e\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Kommer du i skole?\\nFriend: Ja\\nFriend: Til dtddb\\nFriend: Har du skifte t\u00f8j med til yoga\\nPersona: Har bare et par shorts med\\nFriend: Fair\\nFriend: Ill do the same\\nPersona: Sure thing\\nPersona: Bike or metro?\\nFriend: Nike\\nFriend: Bike haha\\nPersona: Perfekt\\nFriend: what time should we leave\\nFriend: for yoga\\nPersona: Christoffer missed your call.\\nPersona: Does it hurt?\\nFriend: Nah it\u2019s fine for now I\u2019m all numbed up still\\nFriend: Prob hurt later tho\\nPersona: Can't wait to get mine out \ud83d\ude1b\\nFriend: does it hurt\\nPersona: Not yet\\nPersona: Can\u2019t even drink water\\nFriend: ye its a pain\\nPersona: The real pain is beginning now tho\\nPersona: How r u feeling?\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: sp210?\\nFriend: Airidas called you.\\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\\nFriend: no clue\\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\\nPersona: Also, plz check the mails I've added in the bottom. R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\\nFriend: Will do, sorry had a full day\\nFriend: Ye\\nPersona: No worries. I\u2019ll be at school tmr, and I\u2019ll send the other mails out if u approve\\nFriend: I am free tommorow too\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: What do you mean again? \ud83d\ude06\\nFriend: So I dont copy my own data? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: Because everything got reorganised, and it anything prior is useless 2 keep after the structure got updated\\nPersona: Exactly, so u don\u2019t copy yourself:)\\nPersona: Because I\u2019m gonna interlink our notes\\nPersona: Micro is also organised now. Keep the difference  in mind:\\nFriend: BDA, Unsupervised learning - date:11\\nFriend: oh okay\\nFriend: Wow you seem deep into this :D\\nFriend: Hey, I found the reason for the huge file size on your CMR map. Its due to that you have attached two powerpoints to the map.\\nFriend: I have removed those on a copy and now its 13mb\\nFriend: High file size leads to long saving times and when concentrated on a single topic can lead to out of memory issues on for example copy/paste.\\nFriend: I would suggest attaching files via link not by emebedding them into the mindmap.\\nFriend: like an 'alias'\\nFriend: Missed the lecture about algorhythm stuff in MCMR, so the notes from 'L4 - Platform communication' were particularly useful, thanks!\\nPersona: It\u2019s satisfying 2 me:)\\nPersona: Just saw this now. Thx, I\u2019ll note this\\nPersona: Off course, I\u2019m glad 2 collaborate!\\nPersona: Thx:)\\nFriend: I made a calculator for game theory during the lesson if you need :D\\nPersona: Micro \u201cS7_W11 - Game Theory\u201d\\nPersona: And ML \u201cS7 - Visualize\u201d is updated\\nPersona: The calculator is pretty cool btw\\nFriend: You think so \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: maybe I should share it with the class if its useful\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: Hmmm, feel you \u263a\ufe0f I\u2019m happy you\u2019re exploring \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: We can use WhatsApp it\u2019s just a bit slower\\nFriend: Lol this message just came through because I wasn\u2019t on my vpn before\\nFriend: \u200eWaiting for this message.

I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.

It was a little out of character 4 u 2\\nPersona: 2 use a Mac^:)\\nFriend: I think I am just too used to windows\\nPersona: I still recommend looking at obsidian. I\u2019m happy with it so far\\nFriend: thing is that I cant make links with block (page element) destinations\\nFriend: So I can link to exact points if that makes sense. Especially if I  have few pages withh toggle lists\\nPersona: U can do exactly that tho\\nPersona: [[whatever#heading]]\\nFriend: Am I doing it wrong?\\nFriend: Man for the whole week I have been thinking deeply about this note-taking approach and I am giving it a lot of time, testing a bunch of tools, cause slowly I am realizing that mindmanager has had some lacking things and hasn't caught up on then for all 5 years I have been using it.\nThe main problems are that mobile support is basically read-only.\nIt has almost no community. So not much plugins, no support. Any plugins that exist are paid.\nIt's very expensive. ~19eur/month and yearly subscription only. I can't pirate it on work mac, cause rules :(\nThrough out 5 years of development that I witnessed, prettymuch almost no features were added. Just speed improvements. The spirit of the company making it seems dead.\nIts hard to customize. idk on what its built, but there is little room for functionality customization compared to Loqseq and Obsidian for example, where you can just dig into the code.\nStill no proper support for tables.\n(not a necessary one) but no support for auto queries and databases (dataviews), that give some automation.\\nFriend: But there are also a lot of great features that I been using a lot and the whole approach to presentation is actually one-off unique to the whole note-taking tools. Obsidian is page based, Loqseq is a bulletjournal and MindManager is smth close to bulletjournal but with horizontal expansion.\n\nI've searched 10s of times no other note-taking app as capable as the three of these here with horizontally expanding bulletjournal approach exist. All the other mindmapping software are highly inferior, not well made for it.\\nFriend: So I am ready to give away this approach and the closes to it is the bulletjournal, which Roam or Logseq has. But still MindManager had a bunch of features I really utilized that I need to get ticket. Been trying to do it with Logseq mostly, but also been using Obsidian a bit don't he side. Once I go deep enough with Logseq, I will try Obsidian\\nFriend: Actually I would really like Obsidian to fit my criteria, because it has much bigger community and seems more stable.\\nFriend: I will let you know in the end what I conclude\\nFriend: Is there something that you think Obsidian has unique? Also is there something you would like it to have? So I can have these things in mind.\\nPersona: The section needs 2 be a heading already. So u have 2 make # in front of physical;)\\nFriend: yup I know, its called dataview on obsidian, thats what I reffered to\\nFriend: I know there is a bit, I explorer it, but its inferiot to logseq, thats atleast what I found on forums. One example is that you cant do block references, unless you clutter evert single block with #\\nFriend: I am testing obsidian now using it as a personal diary and I am liking it so far\\nFriend: I totally agree on the community part, its superior to any other alternative\\nFriend: And yeah after tst I would love to hear your tricks and hack with obsidian \u2764\\nFriend: How are you doing man? It's been a while\\nFriend: I am getting a bit crazy with note-taking approaches. I have been using all three for the pats months - Obsidian, Logseq and Mindmaps\\nFriend: I wish I could combine them all. At this point I was actually dreaming of developing my own software hahaha, combining the best of all worlds\\nPersona: I know what u mean. The IMO exam made me look into how both Notion and Obsidian could be used collaboratively for managing projects, like Monday/Coda/ClickUp. The biggest problem is deciding between all of the options, and it\u2019s harder when its for an entire organization\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface.

Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know.
