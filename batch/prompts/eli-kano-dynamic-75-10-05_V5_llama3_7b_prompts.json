I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor?

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical.

I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure.

The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting!

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting!

I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Get your Afro back!\\nFriend: Neveeeeet\\nPersona: Or really long\\nFriend: Maybe yeas\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: Miss uuuu\\nPersona: Miss u 2!\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nPersona: \ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Love it\\nFriend: Aaaaah so cute omg!!!!\\nFriend: What happened???\\nPersona: I blackouted and hit my head yesterday\\nFriend: Oh Nikki\\nFriend: Noooo * wtf ahahaha\\nFriend: But is it serious?\\nPersona: It\u2019s okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s really nice\\nPersona: Just gonna get a scar\\nFriend: I\u2019m happy\\nFriend: Oh no\\nFriend: But it\u2019s okay\\nFriend: Could be worse\\nPersona: It's not that bad\\nFriend: Ah yes it\u2019s okay\\nPersona: But I have been crazy drunk last night\\nFriend: Jesus ahahah\\nFriend: Ahhhhhh so cutessssss\\nPersona: That cat is so sweet!\\nFriend: It\u2019s so cute I love it\\nFriend: I love it are u in the zoo or something\\nPersona: Just in the Nature lmao\\nFriend: Love it\\nPersona: Someone Truman look sexy huh\\nFriend: Omg this photo is about my cat I\u2019m not supposed to look sexy\\nFriend: Should I delete it\\nFriend: Oh no\\nPersona: Why did u delete it hahahahh\\nPersona: It's not a bad thing lol\\nFriend: Ahahahahah I know but it wasn\u2019t supposed to looks sexy\\nFriend: My family follows me\\nPersona: It's pretty subtle u know\\nFriend: How are you doing?\\nPersona: I\u2019m gr8 actually\\nPersona: Chilling in Berlin rn\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Wow that\u2019s great!\\nFriend: Im okay as well\\nPersona: I heard the news about u and goncalo\\nPersona: Hope u r still friends\\nFriend: Yeah I know\u2026\\nFriend: We are of course\\nFriend: Im still kinda hopeful things will work out in the end\\nPersona: Let me know if u wanna talk or smth\\nPersona: I'm glad 2 hear\\nFriend: Maybe it\u2019s too soon to say this but I know he is one of the loves of my life\\nFriend: Thanks Elias!

When we were still together I asked him to tell her that he was with me because I was more confort\u00e1vel with her knowing and a few days after she books a flight to come? Suspicious if you tell me\\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Student number: 153852\\nPersona: Can I get u 2 fill this out on canvas?

The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before.

Is there a way 2 include them w/o a separate social influence sim (the implementation I intuitively imagine)?\\nPersona: Everything makes sense 2 me\\nPersona: If I understand u correctly, I agree. KMS' r boring for specific organizations, and I would only find it interesting if we could approach it a bit more abstract/theoretical, 2 think of a general purpose (what I think u describe as \"external\"?) approach to knwl mgmt\\nFriend: we modify the code\\nFriend: publicy available knowledge management\\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc? I believe I tagged u\\nFriend: wait just got home, eating, will take a look very soon\\nPersona: Update on our status. Got 7*no, and I think we should send followups to Karol, Mads, Tawfiq, Timothy, and GG (each from the opposite account as the one where we send the original mail), what do u think?\\nFriend: 7no's :o\\nFriend: from how many outreaches?\\nPersona: When we submit a proposal we have 2 fill out the supervisor field. What do we do if don't get 1?\\nPersona: 17 i believe\\nFriend: dam  man u have been working hard\\nFriend: but wtf is so hard\\nFriend: dunno, thats is so fucked up, like getting a supervisor is like almost more worry than writing the thesis wtf\\nPersona: What was this library? Wanna check if it's good with NLP\\nFriend: SimPy\\nFriend: I think\\nFriend: Its very general I think, it should be good. its just a framework\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: okay I saw the emails. fucking hell\\nFriend: everyone is taken\\nPersona: Mistake, or u want 2 call?:)\\nFriend: I wanted to call, its simplier than typing\\nFriend: yeah these plugin stores are definetely platforms\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: But the first look like dog food tbh\\nFriend: AHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA\\nFriend: yep it doesnt look good\\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0d\\nFriend: Miss uuuu\\nPersona: How r u?\\nFriend: Beautiful\\nFriend: We are greatttt\\nFriend: Hanging out in Lisbon\\nPersona: So nice.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc? I believe I tagged u\\nFriend: wait just got home, eating, will take a look very soon\\nPersona: Update on our status. Got 7*no, and I think we should send followups to Karol, Mads, Tawfiq, Timothy, and GG (each from the opposite account as the one where we send the original mail), what do u think?\\nFriend: 7no's :o\\nFriend: from how many outreaches?\\nPersona: When we submit a proposal we have 2 fill out the supervisor field. What do we do if don't get 1?\\nPersona: 17 i believe\\nFriend: dam  man u have been working hard\\nFriend: but wtf is so hard\\nFriend: dunno, thats is so fucked up, like getting a supervisor is like almost more worry than writing the thesis wtf\\nPersona: What was this library? Wanna check if it's good with NLP\\nFriend: SimPy\\nFriend: I think\\nFriend: Its very general I think, it should be good. its just a framework\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: okay I saw the emails. fucking hell\\nFriend: everyone is taken\\nPersona: Mistake, or u want 2 call?:)\\nFriend: I wanted to call, its simplier than typing\\nFriend: yeah these plugin stores are definetely platforms\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\\nFriend: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nFriend: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\\nFriend: well*\\nPersona: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\\nFriend: Hey, have you used Notion?\\nPersona: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\\nPersona: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\\nFriend: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk.

I\u2019m about 2 add the sources atm. Can I call u in 20?:)\\nFriend: Don't want to interrupt you :) How are you doing? I think, I'm understanding the modells better now. I think, I'm not deep enough in the topic to understand it  though. Maybe you can add some more sources and elaborate in the analytical part?

If u want 2 I would very much appreciate if u can find time 2 call me before 10, so I perhaps can understand the missing links better:)\\nFriend: I\u2019ll make a simple sum up of each paragraph tonight. I\u2019ve been very much in doubt about how much the term \u201clogics\u201d could overarch. It\u2019s supposed to cover structure-agent dynamics in institutions, market incentives of capitalism, and design mechanisms in social media (essentially deliberate incentives created by the platform)\\nFriend: when phil didn't understand my paper. I tried to sum up every section in veryx easy language and then he was looking through the section and could tell me where the missing links were :)\\nFriend: I'll look into that specifically:)\\nFriend: And you could try to sum up the findings from the Modells which are important to answer your question in the end of every Modell section? :)\\nFriend: To answer your research question\\nFriend: Maybe you can explain in the beginning why you have chosen the different theories/Modells\\nFriend: Is it any specific section u find 2 lack more specifically? \\nFriend: I'll try to be more elaborate, thankyou!\\nFriend: I can read through it tomorrow morning again. :)\ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: Hi there :) I guess, you're deep in the topic. \ud83e\udd13 I'm having a hard time understanding what you want to say. As I guess, you're also needing more characters written down? Can you maybe elaborate and explain more? :) just as you want to explain it to a friend? I think by elaborating, you're structure will also get better as I or your supervisor/professor can better understand why you are talking about the frameworks etc.\\nFriend: I\u2019m out atm. But gonna be back in 2h :)\\nFriend: ^Here it is. I think the structure is already better, and I have 2 take a break 2 eat now\\nFriend: Better done than perfect, honey! \ud83d\ude18\\nFriend: oki, just send it to me when you feel like sending.\\nFriend: At 11.00 tmr\\nFriend: I'm pretty flexible today. Therefore, you don't have to stress. When do you have to hand in?\\nFriend: of course :)\\nFriend: The thing I hope u can help me with is the \u201cbird vision\u201d. I feel like that\u2019s the only real struggle 4 me. Specifically, that the chronology of the paper is coherent, and that it does not jump over 2 big gaps in between paragraphs. Does it make sense?:)\\nFriend: Please don\u2019t read it yet. Only the table of content is worth to look at perhaps. I\u2019m at the visas office rn and feeling pretty stressed out. I wanna finish send you the newest draft in an hour (maybe I should put it in docs, so I don\u2019t waste transfer time, and you can see it whenever online\u2026?)\\nFriend: It's still messy. I'm just trying 2 fix the coherence atm\\nFriend: sure, ofc :)\\nFriend: Hiii. I have 2 hand in my big assignment Friday. Is it cool if I send u a draft tonight?:)\\nFriend: We\u2019re in arken\\nFriend: For us too\\nFriend: 16.30 In reality\\nFriend: Well be there at the same time\\nFriend: We try to be at your home around 16h :)\\nFriend: Perfect, looking forward \ud83e\udd17\\nFriend: Sounds good.

Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time.

I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc).

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It's def the most up 2 date example.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It's def the most up 2 date example. I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

I'm celebrating Christmas that \"evening\"\\nFriend: Honestly, my current goal is as early at 8am\\nFriend: so I can find parking close to SP without needing to park and walk from dalgas\\nFriend: I plan to stay whole day and just work on thesis, masters research & stuff :D\\nPersona: Cool! I\u2019m living right next 2 Dalgas atm\\nPersona: I will do my absolute best to 2 wake up as early as u 2 then!\\nFriend: no no dont need to match me\\nFriend: come anytime\\nFriend: I will use my solo time wisely before u come\\nFriend: Don't wake up early for me btw, I might end up taking the bus and coming at 9\\nPersona: Sounds good.

Is there a way 2 include them w/o a separate social influence sim (the implementation I intuitively imagine)?\\nPersona: Everything makes sense 2 me\\nPersona: If I understand u correctly, I agree. KMS' r boring for specific organizations, and I would only find it interesting if we could approach it a bit more abstract/theoretical, 2 think of a general purpose (what I think u describe as \"external\"?) approach to knwl mgmt\\nFriend: we modify the code\\nFriend: publicy available knowledge management\\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in?

I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it. If not, I will read smth else about our three topics.\\nFriend: and l'll send those two emails in a bit\\nPersona: Can u tell me online?\\nPersona: Don't feel pressured 2 dive deep into MaaSim\\nPersona: Finished rony's mail\\nPersona: Gave input on Rob's\\nPersona: I think Carsten's is good 2 go\\nPersona: I made a mail that's both for Eric and Dan together, since it seems ingenuent if they talk about it together somehow\\nPersona: Theirs is ready 4 review 2\\nPersona: Just looked at IOANNA, and I thought about; why not just show up 2 her office hours tmr?\\nPersona: Do you also simply divide out personalized cold emails so we send idea 1 and 2 to non-tech people, while 2 and 3 go to the technical people?\\nPersona: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well. Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Student number: 153852\\nPersona: Can I get u 2 fill this out on canvas? The deadline is today. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s noon or midnight\u2026\\nPersona: That\u2019s an accurate description!\ud83e\udd20\\nFriend: fuck im omw to school\\nFriend: ok im trying\\nFriend: 153325\\nFriend: what did u write in topic?\\nFriend: I subm\u016btted\\nFriend: but I will send the email when at school\\nFriend: cuz driving\\nPersona: Only 1 person has 2 do it\\nFriend: okay so we I did submit\\nFriend: I did*\\nFriend: I sent him an email\\nPersona: The format is broken 4 me. Maybe check on your device\\nFriend: good on laptop\\nPersona: Perfect\\nPersona: Gemini pro api is free <60 calls/h\\nPersona: Need vpn tho bc of region limit\\nFriend: Where?\\nFriend: What did u use for image&text prompts?\\nPersona: 50+ countries\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t try yet, just checked their pricing scheme\\nFriend: no no  not gemini\\nFriend: any tool/model\\nFriend: but not dk ? \ud83d\ude43\\nPersona: Do u mean how I interact with the pre trained models? The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version. It\u2019s essentially just making it easier 2 use weights from other models, but the core tech is \u201cllama.cpp\u201d (which also has a python api, in case ollama can\u2019t do enough)\\nPersona: Yeah, it\u2019s weird\\nFriend: It allows sending an image and asking about it?\\nPersona: U need 2 pick a model before. I only know llava and baklava that do (through ollama)\\nFriend: Alright thanks\\nPersona: Do u wanna talk after class or tmr perhaps? Just structure our project timeline\\nFriend: Yeah, lets talk\\nFriend: today after class (or during, the class is super boring haha)\\nPersona: Gotchu\\nPersona: Still raining. Held og Lykke\\nFriend: I passed nice\\nFriend: Thank you man\\nFriend: I am coming at 16\\nPersona: U passed before it started?\\nPersona: I\u2019m sry, but I can\u2019t come. I\u2019m responsible 4 food club at my dorm today?\\nFriend: ahahahah\\nFriend: yeah, as soon as I told them I had the courtesy to practice with Elias, and they asked no more and passed me\\nPersona: Lmao\\nFriend: is there reading for KLC tommorow?\\nFriend: in case u checked\\nFriend: do you want to split the payment for cases?\\nPersona: Sure. Did they change from last year?\\nPersona: Didn\u2019t check yet\\nFriend: no for today\\nFriend: Yeah, a few\\nFriend: the first repo in w reply for the first commentt might be interesting when thinking how to encode persona\\nPersona: Let's purchase at school\\nFriend: alright\\nPersona: Looks interesting. I'll check the repo\\nPersona: Did u fix up a github page?\\nFriend: not yet\\nFriend: are u coming to Research Methods?\\nFriend: About Mixtral\\nFriend: ahh git is really fucking with me. Why do you need me to make a repo?\\nFriend: Apprently you can create a git repository in a Google Drive folder\\nFriend: But\\nFriend: since I like to learn stuff, I will find a workaround\\nFriend: I will do the script later, I got a little bit annoyed while bulding it\\nFriend: For now I will manually move items to it from time to time\\nPersona: Ill be at DS 12 w/ u\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: wya?\\nFriend: oh fuck\\nFriend: I am.in wronf one\\nPersona: 2.08 In 1 sec\\nFriend: btw in case you missed it, I shared the cases with you on a G drive invite\\nFriend: The first case is super cool tho\\nPersona: I saw thx\\nPersona: Just finished it. It sure sounds like an interesting org 2 work in!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I see you are enjoying the monkeys\\nPersona: Yeah They where sweet, except when they stole my moms sandwich\\nFriend: Did you pet them?\\nPersona: No actually not, my parents said it was a bad idea\\nPersona: Any news about Bella sky or guldsmeden?\\nFriend: I will need your cv\\nPersona: I Will send it to u now\\nFriend: I will send it to her. She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\\nPersona: I'll go get a haircut now, so will be a bit offline 4 a while\\nFriend: alright\\nFriend: I speedrun the rest of DIGI and most of innovation departments\\nFriend: Overall, there are plenty of fish in the sea\\nFriend: I think we can make send them standardized versions, where we only customize the selection and inclusion of the three ideas.\\nFriend: And then send personalized follow up for VIPs\\nPersona: Aggree. I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc? I believe I tagged u\\nFriend: wait just got home, eating, will take a look very soon\\nPersona: Update on our status. Got 7*no, and I think we should send followups to Karol, Mads, Tawfiq, Timothy, and GG (each from the opposite account as the one where we send the original mail), what do u think?\\nFriend: 7no's :o\\nFriend: from how many outreaches?\\nPersona: When we submit a proposal we have 2 fill out the supervisor field. What do we do if don't get 1?\\nPersona: 17 i believe\\nFriend: dam  man u have been working hard\\nFriend: but wtf is so hard\\nFriend: dunno, thats is so fucked up, like getting a supervisor is like almost more worry than writing the thesis wtf\\nPersona: What was this library? Wanna check if it's good with NLP\\nFriend: SimPy\\nFriend: I think\\nFriend: Its very general I think, it should be good. its just a framework\\nFriend: You missed a call from Airidas.\\nFriend: okay I saw the emails. fucking hell\\nFriend: everyone is taken\\nPersona: Mistake, or u want 2 call?:)\\nFriend: I wanted to call, its simplier than typing\\nFriend: yeah these plugin stores are definetely platforms"

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: what about thursday evening?\\nFriend: this is the topics I think we both matched on interest, but I may have missed some\\nPersona: Got football practice in the evening.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday"

Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep.

Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc? I believe I tagged u\\nFriend: wait just got home, eating, will take a look very soon\\nPersona: Update on our status. Got 7*no, and I think we should send followups to Karol, Mads, Tawfiq, Timothy, and GG (each from the opposite account as the one where we send the original mail), what do u think?\\nFriend: 7no's :o\\nFriend: from how many outreaches?\\nPersona: When we submit a proposal we have 2 fill out the supervisor field. What do we do if don't get 1?\\nPersona: 17 i believe\\nFriend: dam  man u have been working hard\\nFriend: but wtf is so hard\\nFriend: dunno, thats is so fucked up, like getting a supervisor is like almost more worry than writing the thesis wtf\\nPersona: What was this library?

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday"

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It's def the most up 2 date example.

I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It's def the most up 2 date example.

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical.

She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I see you are enjoying the monkeys\\nPersona: Yeah They where sweet, except when they stole my moms sandwich\\nFriend: Did you pet them?\\nPersona: No actually not, my parents said it was a bad idea\\nPersona: Any news about Bella sky or guldsmeden?\\nFriend: I will need your cv\\nPersona: I Will send it to u now\\nFriend: I will send it to her. She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist.

I just arrived home safely:)\\nFriend: Hey, have you used Notion?\\nPersona: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\\nPersona: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\\nFriend: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\\nPersona: I\u2019d be down 2 look into it next week. But 4 now I focus on my DO\\nPersona: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\\nFriend: yeah same\\nFriend: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\\nPersona: Yeah, why?\\nPersona: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\\nPersona: Forgot it was exercise class\\nFriend: umm\\nFriend: Yeha if you are at cbs?\\nPersona: I\u2019m nearby, at station\\nPersona: I got until 14 if u want any help;)\\nFriend: damb what are you doing?\\nFriend: I still have a lecture\\nFriend: Its ending now, but I have a study group meeting\\nFriend: so idk maybe later, unless you want to join my study group meeting \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: 3d printing\\nPersona: Which class?\\nFriend: IMO\\nFriend: at porcelehavensej\\nPersona: I see.

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically.

Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing!

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: It's def the most up 2 date example. I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

Is there a way 2 include them w/o a separate social influence sim (the implementation I intuitively imagine)?\\nPersona: Everything makes sense 2 me\\nPersona: If I understand u correctly, I agree. KMS' r boring for specific organizations, and I would only find it interesting if we could approach it a bit more abstract/theoretical, 2 think of a general purpose (what I think u describe as \"external\"?) approach to knwl mgmt\\nFriend: we modify the code\\nFriend: publicy available knowledge management\\nFriend: So you want to meet again tommorow?\\nFriend: I am free/flexible all day\\nPersona: I meant what part of the delivery operation in the MSP they would incorporated in?

I really hope ones that we sent replies\\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: this song is so good\\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold"

It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: That girl is so toxic Elias and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that anymore because he doesn\u2019t realise\\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \\nFriend: I did not understand a thing ahahahah\\nPersona: \u201cI cheer on u!\u201d\\nPersona: It means I support u/i\u2019m on ur team\\nFriend: Ahhhh okay\\nFriend: That\u2019s great ahahahah\\nPersona: Sounds like \u201cI cheat on u\u201d lol\\nFriend: Yeahhhh ahahha\\nPersona: Let me come 2 this party!\\nFriend: You will come to my basement parties for sure\\nFriend: You\u2019re just living your best life\\nPersona: Can't argue with that\\nFriend: Ahahahah\\nPersona: Happy birthday!!!

Is there a way 2 include them w/o a separate social influence sim (the implementation I intuitively imagine)?\\nPersona: Everything makes sense 2 me\\nPersona: If I understand u correctly, I agree.

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\\nPersona: I\u2019d be down 2 look into it next week.

What r u doing there tho?:)\\nFriend: Just chilling with a friend\\nFriend: I think I may also start a long-taking switch to a new note-taking app. I didn't like Notion in the end, but Obsidian and Roam Research is something I want to look into\\nFriend: Have you heard of Roam Research?\\nFriend: Okay Roam Research is kinda dead\\nPersona: I\u2019ve heard about it, but I\u2019ll stick with obsidian tho\\nPersona: There is also marginnote 3 if u still want the tree structure of the minimal\\nPersona: Mindmap*\\nFriend: ahh but its for mac only\\nPersona: But you\u2019re on Mac 2 now, no?\\nFriend: only at work\\nFriend: cant start to like it tbh\\nPersona: Fair.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe.

I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it. If not, I will read smth else about our three topics.\\nFriend: and l'll send those two emails in a bit\\nPersona: Can u tell me online?\\nPersona: Don't feel pressured 2 dive deep into MaaSim\\nPersona: Finished rony's mail\\nPersona: Gave input on Rob's\\nPersona: I think Carsten's is good 2 go\\nPersona: I made a mail that's both for Eric and Dan together, since it seems ingenuent if they talk about it together somehow\\nPersona: Theirs is ready 4 review 2\\nPersona: Just looked at IOANNA, and I thought about; why not just show up 2 her office hours tmr?\\nPersona: Do you also simply divide out personalized cold emails so we send idea 1 and 2 to non-tech people, while 2 and 3 go to the technical people?\\nPersona: I've made a draft 2 Ioanna as well. Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor?

I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical.

The app is called \u201cOllama\u201d and works on Mac I know, but it also has a docker version.

I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\\nFriend: He looks pretty old\\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nFriend: I see you are enjoying the monkeys\\nPersona: Yeah They where sweet, except when they stole my moms sandwich\\nFriend: Did you pet them?\\nPersona: No actually not, my parents said it was a bad idea\\nPersona: Any news about Bella sky or guldsmeden?\\nFriend: I will need your cv\\nPersona: I Will send it to u now\\nFriend: I will send it to her. She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv? Talk to you after school, thanks\\nPersona: they have 5 hotels in copenhagen, witch one is it?\\nFriend: thats my email\\nFriend: her answer is\\nFriend: Hi darling,\n \nThat\u2019s about right, just so I know whether to send it to the kitchen department or two reception department etc. Shortly tell what he wants to do/learn at Guldsmeden, does it makes sense?\\nFriend: so basically you are 18 and nobody expects you to have any experience. You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it? Guldsmeden is like Hilton. They have different hotels, where is this one?\\nPersona: Remember to ask in Bella sky for me. And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business.

My plate is full w/ midterms until then:/\\nFriend: Thursdsy I am freer :)\\nFriend: Hey, do you use GPT4?\\nPersona: Yes, why?\\nFriend: Do you use it through ChatGPT Plus?\\nPersona: No api\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: my man\\nFriend: Are you using any of the open source intrfaces?\\nPersona: Most of the time Ive been using a raycast extension. But I've also experimented a bit w/ lm studio - mostly 4 a few open source models (not worth it imo). If it's more complex I use heygpt and playground\\nPersona: What do u use?\\nFriend: ohh raycast chatgpt extension, nice, yeah I am using smth similar\\nFriend: I am using Prompta\\nFriend: it has better code highlighting than chatGPT official UI\\nFriend: but it has a bug with database that I reported but they just implemented a quickfix that barely remedied the iasue\\nFriend: issue*\\nFriend: so I dont recomend this\\nFriend: Do you know any tools where I can voice input chat with GPT through API without paying openai subscription?\\nFriend: Cause voice input is so much easier sometimes\\nFriend: oh heyGPT has that\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: ahh but its paid\\nFriend: actually if it has a windows/mac os app and voice input, would be pretty cool to set it up so I can actibate it with hotkey and they just ask a questioj while doing something\\nFriend: then once its finished, look up the answer. Or like make notes via voice\\nFriend: Like basically an actual assistant while.working\\nFriend: it kind of a enter an area of GPT agents. But smth similar as to make a note, f.e. an .md file in obsidian tagged \"byGPT\". It would be ultra cool.if it would be able to send someone a slack message. But these integrations would probably take a lot to make. Maybe there are pre made onea\\nFriend: I actually had an unexpected realization about our collaboration on thesis.\n\nSince we both want to make sure to choose a topic we like, our discussion together, regardless whether we end up working on together on the thesis, is of itself a good collaboration. We share our ideas, cross validate with each other and also keep momentum on the thesis, especially since we still have a bunch of time to brainstorm (I think?).\\nFriend: And if one of us shares an idea that the other one finds so good, they want to steal it. Well thats perfect, no need for stealing, we can do it together.\\nPersona: How does this only have 41 stars?!\\nPersona: I believe they still have a free tier that's way 2 good, but I need 2 check on the computer before I can confirm\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! Probably achievable 2 make fairly easy w/ whisper api, so there's likely an option if u scan github. I recently realized that it's like people w/ plastic surgery addiction; as soon as they fix what they wanted there is a new flashy thing. So my next minichallenge is 2 learn standard/open source frameworks, like langchain and the huggingface module, 2 just become a lego-thieve\\nPersona: Yeah I'd look into what is made already. I wish there was a GPT 2 scan through all github projects and RAG all of them on the surface. Sort of 2 get an ELI5 repository finder that match what u need in your project\\nFriend: I think the concept is not very unique and there are some other repos on github that do extacly the same.\\nFriend: yeah they do. But they provide voice input only with paid tear\\nFriend: tier*\\nFriend: yeah I could potentialy search for something\\nFriend: shit I never heard a bout langchain, probably since Fireship never made a 100s video on it haha\\nFriend: It sounds interesting, just watched a video\\nFriend: also hearing about huggingface first time. Interestinf platform too\\nFriend: You seem to be very updated in the ml, language model scene\\nFriend: Also RAG, just googled it haha\\nFriend: yeah github lib/project lookup by ELI5 would be nice haha\\nFriend: also academia lookup by eli5 wpuld be nice too\\nFriend: cause I often end up explaining something to chatgpt in very simple terms, out and about, and then ask it how is topic that we discussed called in the professiona/academic world\\nPersona: Fireship is a bit more general, I don't think he wanna pivot 2 the ai wave\\nPersona: ^And I wouldn't want him 2\\nPersona: Perplexity sort of have this. U can pick where it search (wiki, Google, scholar, etc)\\nPersona: Lmk if perplexity solves this if u try:)\\nFriend: ah its only Masters thesis available publicly for CBS students\\nFriend: but maybe thats still good\\nFriend: How is your schedule, did you have enough time to complete and rest after the mid-terms and should we discuss tommorow?\\nFriend: ffs I entered \"Platforms\" into the search bar for CBS theses and now I havea a log of 20+ thesis that I can't live without reading \ud83d\ude2b\\nFriend: I need to read them all. I can't live knowing that I don't know what is behind these interesting headlines\\nFriend: Problem is I don't know how goo they are. They maybe got a grade of 2\\nFriend: If i read stuff like this for fun, I can award myself MSc of Platform management ahahaah\\nFriend: I need to know why now\\nFriend: Oh shiit, this is basicaly how I invest\\nFriend: I should read this\\nFriend: \". With the use of ML models, the drivers for predicting defaults included the sum of repaid interest and principle. This is consistent with industry standards, which project the highest rate of default for consumer loans falling within the first few months of a loan\u2019s term.\"\n\nMaybe the conclusion is enough. I need to adjust my strategy haha\\nPersona: Yes, let's call tonight? Preferably around 14-16-ish Danish time, if that's good 4 u?\\nPersona: I believe the grade wouldn't matter much anyway, since they're master thesis and above. They've already been through plenty of filtering, and thesises is graded fairly generously as far as I'm aware (I believe they're not on a curve anymore)\\nPersona: From \"Airidas school of everything\"\\nPersona: Yeah, what's your article reading strategy/chronology 2 get a sufficient understanding?\\nFriend: yeah\\nFriend: investment strategy\\nPersona: I meant what do u usually read when skimming (e.g. conclusion; if not enough \u2014> abstract, and intro; if not enough \u2014>\u2026 etc). Do u get me?\\nPersona: I'm headed home in a moment. Can we say in an hour or so?\\nFriend: Yeah sure\\nFriend: I just came back home, repaired my bike  \ud83e\udd75\\nFriend: feeling acomplished"

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

You have and this is a plus.\\nFriend: describe shortly where you see yourself in the hotels, why you want to work for them\\nFriend: and the questions above\\nFriend: it should be maybe around half a page\\nFriend: but make it nice and pretty\\nFriend: and if you can be creative\\nPersona: So what hotel is it?

Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions.

I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\\nFriend: In case you didn't see\\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look through the doc and everything before I go 2 sleep. I'll also create a targeted one for Dan (klcm). Then we send out the rest tmr morning, right?\\nFriend: sounds good\\nPersona: I fell asleep. Going 2 Dalgas at noon 2 grind what I'm behind\\nFriend: I'll do some work from home. I plan on reading the MaaSim paper, seeing if I can timebox 1-2hrs to run it.

Gonna make Bens now\\nPersona: How r u holding up?:)\\nFriend: I just finihsed cleaning my dorms hallway cause it was my turn\\nFriend: eating lunch now\\nFriend: then going to get working on the thesis stuff, haven't trouched it today yet.\\nFriend: touched*\\nFriend: So I will get back to you in a bit\\nPersona: Cool cool. I just did some more mails in the doc (see \"review\" marked in headings), and looked through yours. Let's send as many out today as possible, and get ready for some good pitches afterward \u2013 or do u think we should prioritize differently?\\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor? In the different department overviews, we r technically under MSC (w/ comms, fluffy/valgue programs) while DIGI has the HA.IT\\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\\nFriend: Send the same one twice\\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\\nPersona: I see 1-3 going from less to more technical. I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\\nFriend: ok nvm I just read it\\nFriend: lets try it\\nPersona: Nice\\nFriend: never did this, lets see how it goes\\nFriend: do you think sending them and including the conversation with Christiane will be good, regarding that the bottom part is identical?\\nFriend: For Ben and Carsten\\nFriend: how do you see enactment systems relate to the our first idea?\\nFriend: I think its not clearly related\\nPersona: Just checked the word enactment... thought it meant smth else\\nFriend: yeah, no worries, I think I found some topics she wrote on more to our topics\\nFriend: like digital ecosystems, platforms\\nFriend: I like the phrase \" in the realm of our pursuit\" ahahah\\nFriend: I reviewed the one you wrote\\nFriend: I will send the the two ones with your corrections now\\nFriend: I am working all work day tommorow. I could potentially last minute ask my boss to get out for 2 hours, but that will be quite inefficient. Do you think Ionnna is that good its worth doing it?\\nFriend: I am free on Tuesday, so we can meet up again at CBS\\nPersona: Not sure. But what do u think about the strategy? 2 show up at office hours unannounced?\\nFriend: I am a fan of guarilla strategies\\nFriend: so as a strategy I like it haha\\nFriend: lets check if other have office hours\\nFriend: Rob also has on Monday...\\nFriend: I also have a meeting at work at 10:30 \u2013 11:00 and at  15:30 \u2013 15:50, so last minute changing the day I work to tommorow would be quite rude.\\nFriend: hmm\\nFriend: not all of them have office hours, or they are atleast not listed\\nFriend: That was a fast no\\nFriend: I will speedrun screen the rest of ppl from DIGI\\nFriend: the first one I check xddd\\nFriend: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\\nFriend: uhm\\nFriend: 2 year leave wtf. Can that be right?\\nFriend: Also says (on leave) in linkedIn. Tough luc\\nFriend: luck*\\nFriend: Could be potential\\nPersona: Nice of him 2 answer at least\\nPersona: Weird, but he's 2 perfect 2 not send a unpersonal mail\\nFriend: yeah, worth a cheap shot atleast\\nFriend: maybe we'll make the guy comeback\\nPersona: Nice!\\nPersona: I think our email persuasion is through the roof!\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: Jacob missed your call.\\nFriend: You missed a call from Jacob.\\nPersona: You called Jacob.\\nFriend: Dalgas have 15\\nFriend: Go on google maps\\nFriend: Should be a 10 min walk from bitlap\\nPersona: Thx\\nFriend: Did you go to the meeting today at 9?\\nPersona: No, I just arrived\\nPersona: U here?\\nFriend: No haha\\nFriend: But I\u2019ll come to the tour\\nFriend: Was just too tired in the morning\\nFriend: I know that the girls have a girls group chat. Should we make one too?\\nPersona: I just went home as well. I wanna sleep a bit before the tour\\nPersona: U didn't miss anything\\nPersona: Sure we could make one. Is it all of the girls in DM?\\nFriend: Probably not all of them but I thought a bigger group would be good to keep in touch\u2026\\nPersona: sure thing. But exclusively 4 boys?\\nPersona: Maybe we should just make 1 for everyone on FB?\\nFriend: No let\u2019s include girls\\nFriend: Yes\\nPersona: Let's mention it at the dinners\\nFriend: Perfect\\nFriend: When are u playing?\\nPersona: 14.00 probably\\nFriend: What bar r u going?\\nPersona: I'm about 2 leave\\nPersona: 2 meet the others\\nPersona: Idk where they're at/going tho\\nFriend: Ahh so u are going to the bar rn?\\nPersona: Idk, just wanna meet up and get drunk\\nFriend: Hahaha sounds good\\nPersona: Let's get out now\\nFriend: I\u2019ll be there in 35 min\\nPersona: You'll be late 4 a spot bro\\nFriend: Ok I\u2019m on my way\\nFriend: But I need 20 min\\nFriend: Can you save a spot for me\\nPersona: I'll do my best\\nPersona: Its lit\\nPersona: Where r u sitting?\\nFriend: In the back\\nFriend: But on my way to Cantine rn\\nPersona: What number is your study group?\\nFriend: 21\\nFriend: Where r u\\nPersona: Generally, your paragraphs are too short. It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear. And Blue Ocean and Red Ocean are theoretical concepts that need referencing...\\nPersona: My feedback^\\nPersona: My assignment lol^\\nFriend: Thank u !!!\\nPersona: Np\\nFriend: should we leave at 25?\\nPersona: Yes\\nPersona: R u coming 2 exercise class?\\nFriend: I\u2019m on way back to cph but won\u2019t make it in time today\\nFriend: Sorry\\nPersona: np\\nFriend: Jacob called you.\\nFriend: Where should we meet?

I\u2019m gonna create the most updated standardized now\\nFriend: nice\\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\\nFriend: We structure appears to be quite open and perhaps its even possible to plug in an NLP into it technically. Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\\nFriend: Ugh topic choice is so scary for me\\nFriend: all the time\\nFriend: this time the most\\nFriend: out of all\\nFriend: The papaer linked 10+ other mobility simulations\\nFriend: +1 general agent based pyton simulation library\\nFriend: Perhaps an idea is to simulate denmarks situation: taxi's (fixed fleet) vs mobility platform (market controlled fleet)\\nPersona: Will do now\\nPersona: U didn't check Rony's mail?\\nPersona: Amazing! Should I read it now, or wait and focus priorities on supervisors 4 now?\\nPersona: I have a feeling that we will find a middle ground between topic/idea 1 and 2, and perhaps scratch 3 atm (check comments in doc)\\nPersona: What is that 1 called?\\nPersona: I believe the danish market situation is a bit 2 political tbf. Uber is not here as a protectionism measure in order 2 protect taxi drivers' jobs...\\nPersona: Done. Lmk if u want smth changed 4 Rony's, and if we should spam the others (your newest findings) with the standard mail\\nPersona: So you've went through DIGI and ?? (SI, IOA, MSC OM?). The one's u haven't I'll go through. I'll speedrun ECON 2 see if they got smth in the meanwhile\\nFriend: wait, I'll ser later, insane day at work\\nFriend: see*\\nPersona: Don't stress it. Don't look at anything else than this if u r time pressured;)\\nFriend: I went through the first 50-60% of SI\\nFriend: and fully through DIGI\\nFriend: I added to the doc the good ones in Maybe section\\nFriend: no need, I give you a summary\\nFriend: I dont remember, but fuck it, send it\\nFriend: yeah thats what we could simulate \ud83d\ude08. But maybe too political yeh\\nPersona: I'll speedrun IOA, MSC, ECON, and OM then (in that order), and leave the rest of SI 2 u\\nPersona: What should we prepare 4 tmr when seeing Daniel?\\nFriend: but do we really need more than already mapped?\\nFriend: Did we send massages to them\\nFriend: Ughh not sure, there is very little time, lets try to get something more indepth to explain on the two topics: playform sim and nlp focus groups\\nFriend: perhaps we could split some deeper research, I could finish the thinking deeper.on the platform think, you could delve deeper into the nlp focus groups\\nPersona: Already did Econ, halfway through IOA, scratched OM, and don\u2019t want 2 do it anymore rn. So perhaps it can wait till after our meeting, if it\u2019s even necessary as u said.\\nPersona: Nope, check \u201ctemplate 2\u201d and approve if we should just spam it now\\nPersona: Sure thing, I\u2019ll check if there\u2019s been any research on NLP focus groups in a bit\\nPersona: Did u read this reasoning in the doc? I believe I tagged u\\nFriend: wait just got home, eating, will take a look very soon\\nPersona: Update on our status.

Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\\nFriend: Also\\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\\nFriend: This could be huge\\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\\nFriend: love*\\nFriend: I know already one person, who just launched are very focus-group'able startups and who is good connection of mine- they would love my help I know. And we could throw huge impact collabs here\\nFriend: Christiane tho or someone from SI would be better supervisor tho, I might send a third follow up to christiane, or just strom her office haha\\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering. I have overestimated my capabilities of what I would be able 2 do while on ski. I\u2019ll try 2 catch up on everything this afternoon!\\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\\nFriend: yeah I agree\\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\\nFriend: I think should be not\\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\\nPersona: I'll look\\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\\nFriend: He is platforms dude\\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\\nFriend: from him?\\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\\nFriend: perhaps you have any plan to get Jacob going about idea #1 tommorow?\\nFriend: cause if not we should get looking\\nFriend: perhaps\\nFriend: it was nice we could find existing papaers, have things prepared for Daniel\\nFriend: we showed we are serious and won him\\nPersona: I'm looking at Jacob's published papers atm\\nPersona: true\\nFriend: Oh yeah, so idea 1 also touches platforms too, I just remembered\\nFriend: Dude\\nFriend: I just found the term for idea one I think\\nFriend: its reffered to as \"Software Ecosystems\"\\nPersona: sounds accurate\\nFriend: wait a sec\\nFriend: I'll show you some gold"

It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\\nFriend: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it.

But 4 now I focus on my DO\\nPersona: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\\nFriend: yeah same\\nFriend: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\\nPersona: Yeah, why?\\nPersona: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\\nPersona: Forgot it was exercise class\\nFriend: umm\\nFriend: Yeha if you are at cbs?\\nPersona: I\u2019m nearby, at station\\nPersona: I got until 14 if u want any help;)\\nFriend: damb what are you doing?\\nFriend: I still have a lecture\\nFriend: Its ending now, but I have a study group meeting\\nFriend: so idk maybe later, unless you want to join my study group meeting \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\\nPersona: 3d printing\\nPersona: Which class?\\nFriend: IMO\\nFriend: at porcelehavensej\\nPersona: I see.

Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means.

She said that they are not looking for anyone particular but will see why she can do. About Bella sky will ask on Friday when I go to work\\nPersona: Okay cool thanks for the help Nikolay\\nFriend: So I spole with MIa from Guldsmeden Hotels. She said that you might need to write a cover letter.\\nFriend: It should include which area are you exactly interested to work in (reception, bar, service, customer relations, housekeeping, etc.), What kind of job you are looking for (trainee, study job, part-time job next to your school, etc. etc.) and how many hours approximately you will be able to work per week/month.\\nFriend: I am still waiting for an exact answer from her what kind of information you need to include.\\nFriend: in the meantime i would advise you to check their webpage and get to know the hotel better.\\nPersona: by cover letter, do you mean the thing you always give together with your cv?

And it would be perfect if they could tell what type of positions They offer, because I am not sure about what i should apply for\\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search. Mia from Guldsmeden received you cover letter and CV. She told me that there are couple of spelling mistakes but she loved it and find it perfect. She cant promise anything except the fact that she will make sure that your application reaches the right people.\\nFriend: With regards to Bella Sky. Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\\nPersona: I did not get the job...\\nFriend: Just to practice your French\\nFriend: The game is on tomorrow at 16.00 at roskilde I am not starting but will enter at some point hopefully\\nPersona: Still exited to watch\\nFriend: I am in\\nPersona: Nice job\\nFriend: Check anders hemmingsen\\nPersona: How is it possible to appear twice?\\nPersona: He must have a thing for u\\nPersona: Home\\nFriend: Coming\\nPersona: U r on roskilde the 29th\\nFriend: No\\nFriend: Roskilde on Saturday\\nFriend: Wednesday sorry\\nFriend: Saturday big game\\nFriend: Final\\nFriend: The grand opening is on Wednesday\\nFriend: The whole office goes\\nFriend: Everyone hangover on Thursday\\nPersona: I see, I can't watch ur match though\\nPersona: Because I will be camping at the festival from the 29th to get a nice spot with my friends\\nPersona: U should come and see our camp on Wednesday then\\nFriend: Sure\\nFriend: I will be\\nFriend: Backstage\\nFriend: Vile\\nFriend: Vip\\nFriend: HAhahaha\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: I don\u2019t know where this is\\nPersona: Hustler\\nFriend: I don\u2019t care about it\\nPersona: I\u2019ll show u\\nFriend: We have all you can eat and all you can drink\\nFriend: Free\\nFriend: From 10.00 am\\nPersona: No way\\nFriend: Until 01.00 when the bus leaves back to the office\\nFriend: And everyone needs to work the next day\\nPersona: Plz let me have ur wristband afterwards\\nFriend: Sure\\nPersona: Hahahahah\\nFriend: You can go Thursday\\nFriend: With it\\nPersona: Sounds crazy\\nFriend: But the all invlusive is only Wednesday\n\nNEW CONVERSATION:\nPersona: We r going 2 the pyramid.
