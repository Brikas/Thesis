What would you say if the game had cutscenes?," It seems like the conversation has been cut off at a critical point where we need to understand more context before providing an appropriate response. However, based on what's provided, I will assume that you want to know how the Persona would respond if asked about their preference for cuts scenes in video games.

If the persona is being questioned and must choose from given options ""I LIKE IT"", ""I EXPECT IT"", ""I AM NEUTRAL"", ""I CAN TOLERATE IT"" or ""I DISLIKE IT"", then based on what we have, it's not clear which option the persona would select. To determine that, we need more information about their video game preferences and attitudes towards cuts scenes in games.

However, since I am an assistant trained to generate responses using a given context, my response is limited by the available data. Therefore, based on what was provided, I can only infer that the persona might choose from any of these options when asked about their preference for cuts scenes in video games: ""I LIKE IT"", ""I EXPECT IT"", ""I AM NEUTRAL"", ""I CAN TOLERATE IT"" or ""I DISLIKE IT""."
