Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\nFriend: nice\nPersona: Aggree.

And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: love*\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups.

But you know Danish culture more.\nFriend: yeah, i wrote in green my thoughts on each of them. I think they are generally nice.\nPersona: Got them all ready 2 send on your command.

Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\nFriend: nice\nPersona: Aggree.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.
