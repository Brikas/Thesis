Don't stress about work, I'll help u and supply energy drinks. Can I sleep at your place tho?\nFriend: I am sorry Elias, you can still come and visit i will find some time for you, if you do\nFriend: So i can't really offer much time, it's crazy, i hardly have enough time to sleep\nFriend: And next week on Friday I'm gonna go to sofia/plovdiv\nFriend: But i got a third job for this week\nFriend: I thought that situation would be more chill as of now\nFriend: Its called Vidin\nFriend: Hey\nPersona: What is your city called again?\nPersona: How is the situation looking 4 next week? I was thinking 19th to 21st maybe\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Yeah sure. I'll stay put\nFriend: So we can talk about it in a week time?\nFriend: Because now i have 3 incoming\nFriend: Lets wait for the next week to come and i will have more clarity on the events for my internship\nFriend: I just won't be available all day\nFriend: Not much, if you come i will still make time for you, for sure\nPersona: Doesn't seem like u have time then?\nPersona: Damn\nFriend: And before that I'm doing my internship from morning till afternoon\nFriend: From 5 to 10\nFriend: I'm working till 10pm till friday\nPersona: I can find stuff 2 do throughout the day\nPersona: Is there some days you'll be less busy or all the same?\nPersona: It\u2019s 14.55\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nFriend: I don't think he knows much about simulation, but if we explain to him, perhaps he would imagine what we could try to study using a platform simulation\nFriend: Multi-sided I think is almost implicit when talking about platforms\nPersona: But do u think he's knowledgable on simulating them? And also on MSPs?\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: from him?\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nFriend: He is platforms dude\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\nPersona: I'll look\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\nFriend: I think should be not\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

R u cool w/ me sending the same mail 2 them CC'ing u again?\nPersona: Can u find mads' mail?\nPersona: Not completely sure. I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\nFriend: no clue\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nPersona: It's def the most up 2 date example. I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: We are living in such a cool time\nFriend: Would be so fun include this if we go with this topic\nFriend: yup\nPersona: Same room?\nPersona: I'll come 2 u\nFriend: Yeah I am at dalgas\nPersona: R u still at Dalgas?

DH.C.211\nPersona: Found a room\nFriend: Alright, I will join you\nPersona: I\u2019ll go 2 Dalgas have I think. Checking if they have group rooms\nFriend: I confused the names\nFriend: Yeah sorry\nPersona: I see\nPersona: Dan k\u00e4rreman\nFriend: I mean Daniel\nFriend: Ohfuck\nFriend: Dan Hardt\nFriend: He never got a reply from Dan\nPersona: What? Didn\u2019t he say they got a reply in the screenshot above?^\nPersona: Good ides\nFriend: global search of my messages too damn\nFriend: Incredible\nFriend: Its so smooth, its crazy.

And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: love*\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer. I\u2019m trying to research the things he\u2019s referring 2\nPersona: U could check out Kim larsen, Shubidua, and Rasmus Seebach (you'll be any Danish mother in law's favorite)\nPersona: Smart way of learning Danish!\nFriend: this song is so good\nFriend: ohh ur going today\nPersona: Was up before 4\u2026 my flight was very early\nFriend: damn early bird, 06:16\nFriend: no worries maan\nPersona: I btw found a superior api subscription. Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nFriend: Elias\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0e\u2764\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Thats fucking stupid, cause the same applies 4 boys\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: I\u2019m good.

I just emphasize the platforms in 2 for non-tech, and the sim in 2 for tech\nPersona: The same to Eric and Dan?\nFriend: I tried to exclude the non-fitting parts fully in the email, perhaps we could introduce them if we talk to them. That increases change of landing a meeting\nFriend: Send the same one twice\nFriend: Hmm, I would not do that. I think they will just expect each other to reply and nobody will or they will take it less seriously.\nFriend: no worries, its more like I want to do it haha\nFriend: I'll show you next time we meet\nPersona: Btw u remember I said we weren't the most technical bachelor?

Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist.

I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good.

Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\nFriend: nice\nPersona: Aggree.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search.

Don't stress about work, I'll help u and supply energy drinks. Can I sleep at your place tho?\nFriend: I am sorry Elias, you can still come and visit i will find some time for you, if you do\nFriend: So i can't really offer much time, it's crazy, i hardly have enough time to sleep\nFriend: And next week on Friday I'm gonna go to sofia/plovdiv\nFriend: But i got a third job for this week\nFriend: I thought that situation would be more chill as of now\nFriend: Its called Vidin\nFriend: Hey\nPersona: What is your city called again?\nPersona: How is the situation looking 4 next week?

And also on MSPs?\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: from him?\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nFriend: He is platforms dude\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\nPersona: I'll look\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\nFriend: I think should be not\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\nFriend: no clue\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nPersona: It's def the most up 2 date example. I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: We are living in such a cool time\nFriend: Would be so fun include this if we go with this topic\nFriend: yup\nPersona: Same room?\nPersona: I'll come 2 u\nFriend: Yeah I am at dalgas\nPersona: R u still at Dalgas?

And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: love*\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nFriend: Elias\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0e\u2764\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Thats fucking stupid, cause the same applies 4 boys\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: I\u2019m good.

Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist.

I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good.

Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\nFriend: nice\nPersona: Aggree.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search.

Don't stress about work, I'll help u and supply energy drinks. Can I sleep at your place tho?\nFriend: I am sorry Elias, you can still come and visit i will find some time for you, if you do\nFriend: So i can't really offer much time, it's crazy, i hardly have enough time to sleep\nFriend: And next week on Friday I'm gonna go to sofia/plovdiv\nFriend: But i got a third job for this week\nFriend: I thought that situation would be more chill as of now\nFriend: Its called Vidin\nFriend: Hey\nPersona: What is your city called again?\nPersona: How is the situation looking 4 next week?

And also on MSPs?\nFriend: but not on the other 2 I gues\nFriend: I think Carsten could be quite an expert on platform, so its beyond what one would call laymans perspective\nFriend: from him?\nPersona: Perfect then! So we'll get a layman's perspective 4 each idea\nFriend: He is platforms dude\nPersona: I'll check Carstens profile out afterwards\nPersona: Probably a good Idea\nFriend: Didn't think about idea 2 lately. But I think I should since we might be able to talk to Carsten\nFriend: Okay so with Jacob we have to talk idea 1 I think\nFriend: Should I send a quick email\nFriend: I think Carsten did not reply\nPersona: Can u send me the link 4 Jacob's tmr morning? 4 some reason I can't access it\nPersona: It's Jacob tmr morning, and Carsten afternoon I believe\nFriend: Because perhaps otherwise there is a point that the model was trained on the answers\nFriend: Like what is the last day of the data used for model training\nPersona: We'll just meet her latter. She can still provide a valuable perspective w/o being our supervisor I believe\nPersona: I'll look\nPersona: Your excitement makes me even more stoked!\nPersona: Sounds gr8! They probably all know smth about their target, while still wanting 2 know more\nPersona: about idea 1 and 2, right?\nPersona: Interesting! Don't understand; training dataset timestamp?\nFriend: I think should be not\nFriend: my dear love is rejecting me\nFriend: Also Christiane rejected us again, with prospect for later discussion \ud83d\ude15\nPersona: Is the YT video comments and transcript smth unrelated 2 conjoint analysis?\nFriend: yeah I agree\nPersona: I don't think we should prioritize him before the deadline tbf. He's bringing unnecessary philosophical abstraction into smth that's more simple imo. Him bringing up \"cybernetics and the law of requisite variety\" seems 2 be based on the presumption that we want 2 prove sim theory of the universe. I thought way 2 much about his mail considering he wrote \"IT-technology\"\nFriend: I literally cant find the email\nFriend: perhaps, I can't find who is it with\nPersona: And also one in the evening, right?\nFriend: Who was the second one that agreed to meet?\nFriend: Dont forget, tommorow 8 -9 AM DK time we have a meeting\nFriend: no worries I was also slow\nPersona: Sry 4 not answering.

I wrote it down in the online intro we had a couple of months ago\nFriend: is that a requirement actually?\nPersona: Do u know if the (only?) requirement of a supervisor being a full time employee incl. phds?\nPersona: I thought about a few others in the bottom. Not as relevant 4 our topic, but I\u2019m evaluating our \u201cbackup\u201d options on vibe check instead\nPersona: Let\u2019s also send these a mail tmr\nFriend: Otherwise, our mapped ones, Mads, Rony, Karol, Tawiq are next up.\nFriend: Its hard to think of other teachers apart from our list. I really hope ones that we sent replies\nPersona: I'm gonna expand the list at the bottom of the doc\nFriend: Later in the evening today, when I am free I'll see if I can consider more supervisors\nFriend: hpefully we are not forced to work with Anna Linda ahahah\nFriend: no clue\nPersona: What do we do if no one will/can supervise?\nPersona: Let\u2019s expand our list like crazy\nPersona: Only Rasmus, yes\nPersona: Wtf hahaha\nFriend: has anybody replied? Cause I might not be getting emails, since I didnt get the one from Rasmus\nFriend: Apparently its harder than we might have assumed\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nPersona: Just saw it, and I'm pretty stoked!\nFriend: I have to show you something pretty cool with AI I realized\nFriend: I wrote two more to Rob and Carsten (in the doc), but I removed one topic from each so I can target them veery precisely. Can you give it a read and then I will send it in the morning?\nFriend: Hey, should we send the emails you wrote to Rony and Eric?\nFriend: In case you didn't see\nPersona: It's def the most up 2 date example. I think it's especially interesting because of the layers to this kind of innovation (shovels to create shovels, enabling other shovels)\nFriend: We are living in such a cool time\nFriend: Would be so fun include this if we go with this topic\nFriend: yup\nPersona: Same room?\nPersona: I'll come 2 u\nFriend: Yeah I am at dalgas\nPersona: R u still at Dalgas?

And we could throw huge impact collabs here\nFriend: love*\nFriend: thats what I lvoe\nFriend: we are litterally sitting at the cutting edge innovation here\nFriend: because its very tangible and its also cutting-edge\nFriend: This could be huge\nFriend: Or better mass produce 2-3 focus groups. We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Didn\u2019t test it yet, but apparently Poe offers unlimited inference for $20/m (not sure if all models r unlimited, but if we go large scale it should be worth it regardless)\nPersona: Sry 4 being offline. Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good. They didn't appear so dry and stood out more\nPersona: I modified, so don't worry\nFriend: oh but if you are time pressured then maybe just send it\nFriend: Alright, I'm writing one to Toke\n## chat conversions between subject and friends\nFriend: Elias\nFriend: \ud83d\ude0e\u2764\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd70\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: Thats fucking stupid, cause the same applies 4 boys\nFriend: Har reageret med \u2764\ufe0f p\u00e5 din besked: \nPersona: I\u2019m good.

Idk conceptually tho (in a way that is systematic and makes sense). Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist.

I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search.

We could even get sponsorship from the startups/CBS themselves.\nFriend: I am dude who has really explore networking wise and I feel super confident it doing our own focus group. We can literally go to CSE, DTU SkyLab, KU Lighthouse, I know folks around there. Collab with a startup, do a focus group for them in real life, then resimulate it.\nFriend: Also\nFriend: I am still very curioius about the idea #1, but idea #3 seems like a solid option. We should be able to have some meetings next week.\nFriend: I have saved a list of links which can potentially contain a useful dataset used for 'conjoint analysis' - a method for market research.\nFriend: There are multiple keywords for market research such as 'conjoint analysis', which can be used to query dataset search engine (Kaggle, Google Datasetssearch, etc.). Plus, i realized there are many platforms from where we can pull data and user characteristics. Also we can maybe think outsite the box and some crazy data gymnastis, like f.e take review articles (like Medium) posted after training dataset timestamp about product X.\nFriend: In thesis.md see FOR ELIAS bullet at root level\nFriend: I've been digging in the idea 3 for the soruces of data and the more I dig the more opportunities I found and I think there are plenty. its sounding more and more feasible at the same time interesting - its could be a big moment of innovation/marketing/data science/prompt-engineering for us :D\nFriend: perhaps we could just talk and hear his point of view\nFriend: He looks pretty old\nFriend: He wants us to be in touch with him, but the ending of the email does not seem like a wish to be in toich haha\nFriend: His email looks quite contradictory to itself\nFriend: Hey, looked at the email now\nPersona: Leif wrote an interesting answer.

Impulsive family visit hijacked my evening\nFriend: Not template but the master bullet point\nFriend: I updated Idea 3 template\nFriend: For Toke, I actually wouldn't like him as thesis supervisor, so will only ask for spariing\nFriend: but maybe I am overthinking too\nFriend: maybe bullet points were pretty good.

Perhaps if we study competition, then it could be interesting.\nFriend: I read most of the MaaSSim paper and the simulation is solid, very clear, looks very extensible and quite deep. It has a huge potential in traffic and transportation research, due to the city and whole movement of the vehicles being simulated, but I don't think thats what is relevant to us. It is however able to simulate competition, driver & traveller learning.\nFriend: Can you send emails to Eric & Dan, Ionna and Ben?\nFriend: I will read the MaasSim paper in the hour that I have left doay\nFriend: nice\nPersona: Aggree.

It's not that they have to be 200 words long, but they do have to be more substantive: they should make a claim (your key sentence) and then spend something like five sentences supporting, elaborating or defending that claim (any less and the support, elaboration or defense becomes to flimsy).  Also, specialize your paragraphs. They should be about theory OR analysis OR discussion. You make them do too many things at once, and so they suffer from what all multitaskers suffer from.  You also have some very funky formatting going on at the bottom of your first page.  I don't know what \"classic innovation\" means. I think you mean something like \"innovation in red ocean markets , but it's not really clear.

Just send an email to the guy who gave me the job there. He is really cool and he is responsible for hiring at the reception. I know that the hotel is always looking for trainees and you have the advantage that you are very young and they can shape you. I sent him the following email.\n\n\nHi Ole, \n\n\nhopefully you are doing great! \n\nRecently I spoke with Pierre from the reception with regards to trainee positions. In the house where I live one of the boys is looking for a trainee job as a receptionist. He is 18 years old, from Copenhagen and still going to school; therefore, he is looking for part-time job in order to learn the business. I think that Bella Sky would be a good option to provide him with a good amount of experience and a good start in the professional life.\n\nI know him already for couple of years. He is very talkative, responsible, stable and most importantly willing to learn and work. \n\nIn the attachment to this email you can find his CV with phone number and email address, so you can contact him in case you think it will be a good match.\n\nOnce again thanks for your help!\n\nSee you around in the hotel!\n\n\n\nKind regards\n\nNikolay\nFriend: ok so a quick catch up on your job search.
