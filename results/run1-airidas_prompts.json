Use this data to understanding the likes and prefferences of the persona.\nPersona: at porcelehavensej\nPersona: IMO\nFriend: Which class?\nFriend: 3d printing\nPersona: so idk maybe later, unless you want to join my study group meeting \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Its ending now, but I have a study group meeting\nPersona: I still have a lecture\nPersona: damb what are you doing?\nFriend: I got until 14 if u want any help;)\nFriend: I\u2019m nearby, at station\nPersona: Yeha if you are at cbs?\nPersona: umm\nFriend: Forgot it was exercise class\nFriend: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\nFriend: Yeah, why?\nPersona: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\nPersona: yeah same\nFriend: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\nFriend: I\u2019d be down 2 look into it next week. But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

Maybe when I\u2019m back\nPersona: we can investigate if u have time\nPersona: i'll come soon to uni\nPersona: weird...\nFriend: Idk, I have plenty of content 2 practice on, I\u2019ll manage\nFriend: The anki desktop app\nPersona: what are you using to see them?\nPersona: weird\nPersona: wtf\nFriend: Most of your Anki cards are empty\nPersona: Thank\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Enjoy the weather\nFriend: Relax hhhaahaha\nFriend: Congrats!\nPersona: but I still want to do econ lol\nPersona: I passed the Econ exam today\nPersona: Dude\nPersona: Is it an auditorium?\nPersona: coming\nPersona: hmm maybe maybe\nFriend: sps04\nFriend: Come if u want\nFriend: I got a whole as room!\nFriend: 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: I am at Justes xd\nPersona: am\nFriend: The others I have are too big\nFriend: Found it\nFriend: weather is nuts outside too\nstill not sure if wanna go for bike?\nFriend: Sh old I get the bed sheet I got for single\nCan check in my bed box\nPersona: yeah\nPersona: yraj\nFriend: So 30 min?\nPersona: Imm heading out\nFriend: ye;

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message.

AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here.

We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time.

Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho.

I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped.

But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code.

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too?

AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well.

But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

Use this data to understanding the likes and prefferences of the persona.\nPersona: at porcelehavensej\nPersona: IMO\nFriend: Which class?\nFriend: 3d printing\nPersona: so idk maybe later, unless you want to join my study group meeting \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nPersona: Its ending now, but I have a study group meeting\nPersona: I still have a lecture\nPersona: damb what are you doing?\nFriend: I got until 14 if u want any help;)\nFriend: I\u2019m nearby, at station\nPersona: Yeha if you are at cbs?\nPersona: umm\nFriend: Forgot it was exercise class\nFriend: I can help u set up the things u need 4 half an hour after class today if u want:)\nFriend: Yeah, why?\nPersona: Do you ever connect mouse to macbook?\nPersona: yeah same\nFriend: Obsidian do have most features u want (more open for community plugins), meanwhile Notion is better at live collaborating (access on all devices)\nFriend: I\u2019d be down 2 look into it next week. But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"

But 4 now I focus on my DO\nPersona: For class note taking, I am thinking right now. \nNeither obsidian neither Notion seems to outweight the ability to organize everything mind a map structure like MindManager allows, especially with interlinking, etc. But I've been using mindmanager for years now and it hasnt shown much development progr\u0119ss, its aimed at big organizations and it overall old fashioned, so I dont like that about it. I think I need to keep my flexibility to change so maybe for one subject I could try Notion or Obsidian with you\nPersona: I just discovered it yesterday and I think I will migrate my todo list from Google Tasks to here. It looked pretty cool for overall like a virtual desk. Maybe you want to explore it together?\nFriend: Do u use this? bc I moved my active vault to iCloud, since I though u didn\u2019t wanna try it out rn\nFriend: I\u2019ve tried it. But not with that much effort tbf. Why?\nPersona: Hey, have you used Notion?\nFriend: Thx! I just arrived home safely:)\nPersona: well*\nPersona: Mad to have a birthday on an exam date, but I hope you celebrated it wrll\nPersona: Hope you get there safe and with your jacket \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\nFriend: Pretty well. Heading home rn:)\nPersona: How are you doing? \ud83d\ude03\nFriend: Thanks bro!\nPersona: Hey man, happy bithday! \ud83e\udd42\nFriend: Thx I\u2019ll give it a shot 4 my next exercise\nPersona: sheets*\nPersona: the last sheet is what Mimi used for excersizes, so I am not familiar with that. But try all the sheets out a bit and ask me if you don't understand smth\nPersona: \"Airi cash flows\" is my best attempt at automating casshflow sttement, but its very complex, so I don't recomend using it\nPersona: The sheet at the end are not really templates\nFriend: Would appreciate that<3\nPersona: But you would need to try it out, so you know how it works. We tried to make most of intuitive and automated\nPersona: If you want, I can share this with you\nPersona: In my study group we made a new template\nPersona: wait, I'll get back to you on the template in a bit\nFriend: current and non-current assets and liabilities? I\u2019ll try 2 change that part, thx\nPersona: I am not familiar with the other sheets, but the one I made, its really hardly fitting final exam, cause it does not differentiate between current and non-current\nPersona: I see, wait\nFriend: The 1 u gave me 4 the retake\nPersona: Which excel sheet?\nFriend: Also, here is a newer version, where I\u2019ve gathered some more sheets from other people as well\nFriend: I just wanted 2 go through the excel sheet with u, if u have time. Bc I feel a little behind with some of it\ud83d\ude15\nPersona: but whats up?\nPersona: Hey, nah at home, studying\nFriend: R u at CBS?\nPersona: Alright I'll get it\nFriend: Ofc;)\nPersona: If you could find the name of the summarizer one that woule be dope\nPersona: Alright, but I like the gpt extensions I got so far, appreciate it for sharing \ud83d\udcaa\nFriend: Not that one. I\u2019ll check in a bit. Personally I only use the other one, bc I\u2019ve boycotted chrome 4 Firefox\nPersona: Is it this one?\nPersona: but I can't find the summarizer\nPersona: THe GPT on Google is nice\nFriend: Both is on chrome. I thing chatgpt on google and gpt summarizer\nPersona: How is the extension called? is it on the chrome store?\nFriend: It\u2019s made by 3rd party, but based on it. There is a Google widget and a summary thing\nPersona: they have extensions with openai? Damn, do you have any particular recomendations?\nFriend: I\u2019ll give them all some tries. Btw, check out the plugins/extensions 4 your browser that use gpt. Super useful!\nPersona: I like The VC, The Ship AI, Bug Basher\nPersona: Yeah this one should be better\nFriend: I found Rick! from Rick and morty\nFriend: I think I got a weird lang. model\u2026\nFriend: It took a while 4 them 2 approve tho. And I mean, it\u2019s inferior 2 chatGPT\nPersona: you could talk to anyone there\nPersona: you must try character.ai\nPersona: :Ddddd\nPersona: nice\nPersona: hm i didnt know we have free acesss\nFriend: They loved it!\nFriend: Hilarious! Especially when I got my brother and dad 2 act\nPersona: ai chat\nFriend: U know, we can have access 2 gpt3 with out studentmail. I have had it 4 almost a year now. Didn\u2019t use it much tho, bc I didn\u2019t find it that easy 2 understand\nPersona: how was it?\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\nFriend: What is it?\nFriend: Ask it 2 do a screenplay, and just act it out\nPersona: its much more relax\nPersona: 4 silly stuff try character.ai also\nFriend: I have used it 4 some silly stuff mainly\nPersona: I asked it today how to interpret working capital in a company and I was much happier with the results vs what I found on google\nPersona: I use it for studying a bunch\nPersona: I see you have discovered chatgpt\nPersona: 1337x.to\nPersona: Is currently the best\nPersona: 1337x\nFriend: Which websites do u usually get your cracked windows software from?\nPersona: Alright, thats good :D\nFriend: But I got tile managers ofc\nPersona: Ahhh sad\nFriend: I\u2019ve been looking 4 smth similar, but it\u2019s not available 4 Mac\nPersona: Really good for note taking while watching slides and looks futuristic af\nPersona: But I've been using AquaSnap for a few years now and it allows to make windows transparent like that\nPersona: Idk if there is for mac\nFriend: Obsidian do have a proper solution 4 this. I think it can handle virtually anything u can imagine, bc of the community plugins. The issue is that u can get in a rabbit-hole of trying 2 optimize things that actually work w/ mint word or whatever software u consider 2 be most normy-targeted\nFriend: I\u2019ll check it out!\nFriend: They r very different, and each software have their advantages. However, I\u2019m still vouching more 4 mindmanager\nFriend: I think the hype is because it\u2019s opensource/free and visually pleasing 2 look at the spiderweb of connection (but arguably totally unnecessary)\nFriend: I believe it\u2019s less time consuming 2 \u201cexplore the map\u201d, but it\u2019s also kind of ruining the concept of MindManager\nPersona: Thats actually one of my biggest complaints with Mindmanager.\nPersona: And yeah, I agree, Mindmanager sucks for not having proper concept for tables\nPersona: I dont solve excersizes in there, but I just take a screenshot of a word formula, convert it to black and put it there\nPersona: But for CF, Mindmanager is working really good for me I think. Check out my CF map, its probably the most develop maps of this semester that I have\nPersona: I should try it sometime\nPersona: I have heard good about obsidian, but never tried it\nPersona: You got to tell me more about this decision with this map sturcture\nPersona: but I am sure you got used to it\nPersona: I'm so used to the default map layouts, that looking at your maps feel like riding a reverse bicycle haha\nPersona: Is that working well for you?\nPersona: Never thought of that\nPersona: hm I see you have an intersting structure\nFriend: ^this means that I consider the src folder more valuable 4 accounting/finance and the mindmanager in DO/GOVO\nFriend: So as u can see, my concern was that word notes w/ a table of content would be a more effective way 2 create a overview of a class (or onenote 4 that matter). At least that is the case w/ our current structure of dividing left and right. However, mindmanager is (IMO currently) shining in the horizontal stretch.\nFriend: I was also temporarely experimenting w/ obsidian, bc mindmanager isn\u2019t ideal 4 math. But I ended up ditching it and made the matematical classes to be primarely in word/excel, wheras my thought was to make mindmanager my dominating tool 4 soft classes (but lowkey have imposter syndrome atm because I\u2019ve been so behind)\nFriend: I\u2019d like 2 see that, bc I was having a similar thought about the stretching\nPersona: I've been also using org charts inside a map layout, so in some cases I prevent the horizontal streching. I can show you sometime in class\nFriend: Nice, i see that u r using the boundaries in a pretty useful way!\nPersona: Still havent made a light themed map, but I have been utilizing some more features now\nPersona: Its been a while since I updated my design, so nice, I am waiting to see your design tommorow\nPersona: Im doing pretty amazing, having a lot of inpiration lately \ud83e\udd29\nPersona: Eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously - nice way to put it haha\nFriend: Hi, yeah it\u2019s been! How r u doing? I am as always going through eternal development in style and doubting it simultaneously. Which reminds me - I\u2019ll have 2 send u the newest style tmr:)\nPersona: Hey man, how r you? It's been a while we talked, shared notes. How is it going? :D\nFriend: Don\u2019t think you\u2019ll need it tbh, but just in case:)\nFriend: This is the the stuff that I\u2019ll bring today + the mindmap\nFriend: Nice that cbs bought the license!\nPersona: finally mindmaps got some attention\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nFriend: 2 your left\nPersona: Are you in the classs? :d\nPersona: \ud83d\ude0c\ud83d\ude0c\nFriend: No worries, I\u2019ll make sure 2 down a drink 4 u;)\nPersona: But have fun \ud83e\udd73\nPersona: Hey bro, thanks for the invite to the party, but I'll be in Lithuania since this Wednessday and sadly I can't make it. \ud83d\ude13\nPersona: Uuu very nice I'll take a look\nFriend: So u can command-f\nFriend: no, just from class\nFriend: I mean I haven\u2019t removed slides that repeat\nPersona: is it anki cards?\nFriend: Just from BDA, but they aren\u2019t sorted tho\nPersona: I'll take a look at it when I am on my pc \ud83d\ude03\nPersona: What are PP's?\nFriend: The only relevant PP\u2019s, if u wanna scroll through\nFriend: How did it go?\nFriend: Damn, i guess I\u2019m starting late\nPersona: I've got a small anki deck\nPersona: Goodluck\nPersona: \ud83d\ude06\nPersona: Im done maaaan\nFriend: Yours is GREAT until L6, where it looked like u stopped. Luckily I got u covered from there:)\nFriend: Just looked at our MCMR maps\nFriend: I will probs get 2 it this Sunday. 4 now I\u2019m busy tho. But feel free 2 ask me about my map:)\nPersona: I will check out your too\nPersona: Hey, we should check each others MCMR mindmaps. Mine looks pretty good for revision for some topics\nFriend: I just tried it myself. Don\u2019t bother\nPersona: Thank you\nPersona: I should\nPersona: interesting, I did not\nPersona: Hm\nFriend: Have u looked at google collab? I didn\u2019t try it myself, but got told that it\u2019s actually running your code on google\u2019s server (more power and takes less time)\nPersona: Kinda, there is not much time. The training takes so long\nFriend: No worries! Hope your project is going good?\nPersona: glad you solved the isue\nPersona: Hey man, sorry, I was really busy :(\nFriend: We\u2019ve solved the issue:)\nFriend: Hey, my group is struggling with a pretty annoying step in our code. If u r not 2 busy, can we then get u to take a look at it?:)\nPersona: Definetely!\nFriend: Yeah, I should be able 2 do better now\nPersona: Well atleast you got more time to study now\nPersona: holy shit\nPersona: Whaat this is so unfortunate\nFriend: I didn\u2019t know this!

And if you are lucky enough to get the actual thing that is missing - and if you solve the missing part, you are almost guaranteed to have a 'sale'. As the person has already admitted whats missing.\nPersona: maybe phrase it differently for the exact occasion\nPersona: Most probably your original message is convincing enough if they read it second time after the time break. And if its not -ask them smth similar to \"what is missing in this offer for your interest?\"\nFriend: thats some pro tips\nPersona: not to convince them with your follow-up\nPersona: Quick short message. The goal is for them to read your original message again.\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: Its true, in my adult life I have been experiencing this more\nFriend: shitty tho.. haven't experienced that in my early life and now in adulthood people just ignore you when you ask them something\nPersona: You are selling your human resource\nPersona: You are a salesmane\nFriend: lol\nsee yourself as a salesman in that positon\nPersona: Hey, just a quick follow-up,\n\nyada yada...\nPersona: Could be as simple as:\nPersona: Just follow-up\nPersona: More sales come from follow-ups than from first contacts\nPersona: And here is the surprising truth\nPersona: This happens a lot in sales\nFriend: probably you've seen that too? What do you do when it happens\nFriend: don't know how to act when I don't get a reply on something from someone\n\nhappened in work and personal life\n\nreally hard to come back and write a second time\nPersona: oh no\nFriend: I think I forgot to press record when i got up\nPersona: Oh there guy are ghosters.

There is a disco group and people collaborate there probably before doing it with others\nPersona: The corporations?\nPersona: How does it work?\nFriend: no idea. I invited you\nFriend: you chatted with him in the disco\nPersona: but why 1 ICA? how does it work?\nPersona: Its the guy who....?\nFriend: currency\nPersona: 1 ICA?\nFriend: universal reserve is rain\nthe dude rfom the chat\nFriend: what? don't get it\nFriend: think you need 1 ICA to join\nFriend: should be able to have more\nFriend: I don't know \nmaybe you can be part of the one im in\ndon't think you can have only one planet members\nFriend: nice\nwould be interesting to see :D and hehlp if possible\nPersona: with Jens econ and business knowledge we will dominate the universe\nPersona: I told about this to Jens and he seems interested\nPersona: But I have my own plan\nPersona: nobody offered my xddd\nPersona: not sure\nPersona: I mean idk idk idk\nPersona: oh\nPersona: xdd\nPersona: I asked him to improve the exchange/all thing\nPersona: I am in this discord yeah\nFriend: he is posting updates to it often\nFriend: the dude behind FIO\nFriend: and PCT prun comunity tool\n\nit's where Saganaki lives\nFriend: i did nothing too but I'm happy with today :D that spreadsheet made my day\nFriend: this dude Zev that is statistician is apparently in mine\nFriend: not just in the official discord\nFriend: join a corp dude :D there is some nice talk in there too\nFriend: talk with her \nshe can use the VRs for the bday so i set up some songs on beatsaber\nPersona: Man I did pure nothing today holy shit\nPersona: I am independent\nPersona: no\nPersona: what is that\nPersona: how do you know>\nFriend: benten based corp\nFriend: are you part of Yellow Fin? AHI\nFriend: cause deflation > inflation\nFriend: we will always be hitting rock bottom selling to MM few goods. That's the equilibrium point\nFriend: the inflation generated will not be enough for us to go out of this ever\nFriend: because of the direction and speed market is heading, multiple materials will probably hit MM\n\nbut eventually we will reach an equilibrium where less of those will be sold to MM \n\nand at the equilibrium point you will always have few tickers being sold to MM\nto counter the permanent deflation\nFriend: a permanent deflation source (will keep on going forever. don't know how else to naem it)\n\nso to counter it (everything generally will go down)\n\nuntil we reach the point where we can have the counteractive measure of inflation (market maker buys)\nFriend: there are 4 thousand ships on Moria someone mentioned\n\nthat's so much fuel for travels being used\n\nyour employees constantly consume too\nFriend: and I'm not talking about buying from MM or aggregate demand or supply or anything like that\nFriend: you have destruction of currency \n\na lot\nFriend: yo\ngo to Juste tomorrow?\nwe can have lectures at my place if you want?\nPersona: ignore all of this\nPersona: Idk why I typed all f this\nPersona: So the costs for human labour are always increasing. We need better entertainment. Simple chess game on a wood board satisfied peoples entertainment for centuries. Now we need 5 new super complex games every year as well as the computers to run them.\nPersona: But I think there is a difference tho. I think its because \"our needs are infinite\". We have marginal utility and we have the hedonic treadmilll.\nPersona: And human labour needs entertainment as input. You can;t live a life without entertainment\nPersona: Well kinda yes. You are producing human labour.\nPersona: For example, you buying that VR is consumption. Is it an input in production tho?\nPersona: Which kinda is and kinda is not like in real life\nPersona: Its really hard to understand this as all consumption is directly an input in production\nPersona: We may not have deflation, as aggregate demand will also increase as more production needs more input\nPersona: and deflation will not occur\nPersona: Actually the money supply can be fixed\nPersona: or maybe not idk\nPersona: yet if we remove MM's then well - we will not have increases in money supply, which will most definitely cause huge deflation.\nPersona: And that it will create a big inflation until it stops.\nPersona: The think I am worried is that the 'eventually' mat take really long\nPersona: I still think its auto-correcting\nPersona: Not competitive meaning that producers will no longer sell to it as it gives a negative profit, due to increased input prices (which increase due to inflation)\nPersona: \"but deflation continues happening regardless?\" If by this you mean increasing aggregate supply, then yes.\n\n\"so we will need to counter it with some inflation\" Until this point I get what your saying. After the inflation grows so much, we will stop selling to MM's.\n\n\"and there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \" As long as the prices for input do not increase. With high inflation, prices for inputs increase too, therefore selling to MM will eventually not become profitable.\n\n\"regardless of the inflationary process they create\nbecause deflation is always happening\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by deflation, but if you mean the growing aggregate supply, then it is an opposite force like you are saying. Then it depends in the difference of what you call inflationary and deflationary forces. If the deflationary force is greater than inflationary, well then the price will stay on the floor, but then also we will not have inflation so selling to MM's does not cause the problem of inflation. \nBut if inflationary force (increasing money supply as a cause) is higher than the deflationary force (increasing technology, total capacity), then eventually as I said before, inflation will ocurr which will eventually make MM bid not competitive anymore.\nFriend: damn\nthey discuss currencies now\n\nI can't.. this is too time consuming\nFriend: ok you have 2 forces. One inflationary and one deflationary\n\nat the moment we are deflating \n\nwe will deflate until we hit the moment someone starts selling to MM\n\nwhen we hit the first good sold to MM maybe we will make enough money in the universe, maybe not\n\nthen more and more goods will be sold to MM\n\nuntil we hit a level where inflation will counter deflation\n\nbut deflation continues happening regardless? \n\nso we will need to counter it with some inflation\n\nand there will be a good or two that will be most profitable and will keep their price on the floor \n\nregardless of the inflationary process they create\n\nbecause deflation is always happening\nPersona: They say that this ill increase the money supply, which will in turn increase inflation. Increased inflation means that prices generally increase, which also applies to RAT, so eventually you will find players that will overbid MM's RAT bids.\nFriend: it will stay at the bottom\nFriend: yeah and it would never be anything different\n\nthey talk that you will hit eventually the time when everyone will just sell their rations to MM\n\nso price won't auto-correct itself\nPersona: The real value is less. You would sell less. (given that costs didn't change)\nPersona: You would as long as it is higher than you opportunity costs. Each period less until its lower than you opportunity cost\nFriend: so you would sell to MM always? I don't see your point\n\nyou'd sell to MM year 1\nand you'll definitely sell year 2 cause real value isn't as high as what you get\nPersona: So its auto-correcting\nPersona: the real price drops*\nPersona: The bid price drops\nPersona: No admins needed. its auto-correcting. If lets say MM bid for ALO is 100 NCC, so at year 1, its real value its 100 NCC, But if the inflation is so high lets say 25% a year, then in year 2, the MM bid for ALO has nominal value 100 NCC, but the real value 75 NCC.\nFriend: not auto-correcting\nadmins correct it if they think its too profitabble from what i understood\nPersona: Its auto-correcting\nPersona: until the MM for ALO bid has a real value that is too low\nFriend: devalue everyones currency\nFriend: like they said\nif ALO is the one most profitable, everyone will just do that do print money :D\nFriend: i do not wanna see MM irl\nPersona: So deflation will kick in after a while. Thats the point I had xd\nPersona: but then there is pretty much no money printing\nPersona: also would be interesting to see PrUn without MM\nPersona: would be interesting to see\nPersona: but thats only imaginary\nPersona: Theoretically governemnt could be like MM in real life. They would pay for the things they bought in new printed money and when the buy things, they just burn the money\nFriend: otherwise I know it's not the same\nPersona: the minimum wages are paid with real money by real producers\nFriend: it's not in the idea that you have a fixed line on your charts where whoever wants to buy or sell can't go below it\nPersona: MM changes the supply of money\nPersona: Min wage is quite different than MM, especially in terms of the discussion we had\nPersona: Can't even see the time pass\nFriend: sadly like Chloe says, the market markers kick in so its not like real world \nyou have these hard limits (like government imposed min wage)\nPersona: I could chat there all day ahah\nFriend: yeah. I've been hanging around those chats \nthere are some interesting stuff\nPersona: you read the discusion on Discord? xddd\nFriend: when they started the discussion\nFriend: my chat was few screens above you starting to write\nPersona: What did you read>\nFriend: you spent an hour writing\ni spent over an hour reading :D\nPersona: Jysk it is\nPersona: okay\nFriend: check your bed size just in acse\nFriend: jysk has a lot\nFriend: never shopped in silvan for sheets\ndon't think they have or low choice\nPersona: which is better for bedsheets, Silvan or JysK?\nPersona: how do you know?\nFriend: rain has been playing from the start and has 300k ncc\ndamn\nthat's a month and a half in\nPersona: okay enougg is enough\nPersona: oh maaaan\nPersona: discussing Market makers in Discord\nPersona: O have spend 1 hours\nPersona: omg\nFriend: you can't have more than 5 offers at the same time on a ticker\nFriend: well I'm almost there :D my current-assets totaling 60k \nbut its on different markets\nPersona: You need atleast 50K to start seeing ship size bottlenecks\nFriend: yeah\n\nand fuels I think will have the same price everywhere for a while (max)\nPersona: but usually the bottleneck will be currency I think\nPersona: Lets maximize everywhere. lets include the fuel tank capacity haha\nPersona: nice\nPersona: oh thats also\nFriend: the fuel calculations cots are based on the cheapest planet to buy from\n\nbut that could bring you extra profit if there are differences\n\nbeause your fuel tanks have separate volume/mass\nFriend: table looks really neat when the groups are separated like that with 2 colors\nFriend: not sure how it fits into all this \nbut return on investment here wouldn't be the same after that\nFriend: it's gonna get a whole lot harder when we involve currencies\n\nbecause on the way back I was looking not for what is going to get me most profit but least losses \n\nbecause on your planet things cost more in general\nFriend: you have 2 ships afterall :D can have one moving between markets and one for your planet and the exchange\nFriend: you don't need a trip back I think\n\nI was trying to see on my last trip if I can make a full circle before going to my planet\nPersona: or its separate?\nPersona: right?\nPersona: as you need the trip back\nPersona: Also shipping costs should be double\nPersona: I made ROI\nPersona: we better add AI1 and CI1\nPersona: FX is super random\nFriend: maybe we can add the currencies\nyou have access to FX\ncause maybe one market is cheaper than the other when you compare just the numbers in any way\nPersona: xdd I think its still forms your mind in the right direction\nFriend: I can profit in a game but not irl ..\nFriend: if we can do this for real life it would be nuts\nFriend: nice chart. I'm putting all my money in h2o before going\nPersona: but oh well\nPersona: I didn't play on doing PrUn sheets today\nPersona: I like this\nPersona: me too\nFriend: I'm happy with this \ntime for a break for me\nFriend: yeah. Unit price can go all the way to the right\nPersona: If this gets too wide\nPersona: After we think its overall finished we should move the most important columns to the left and the less important to the right\nPersona: okay :D\nFriend: its so perfect\nFriend: no\nit's perfect\nPersona: Is this wrong?\nFriend: this is so magical :D\nFriend: if you enter 1 currency less than the max-ship price, the bottleneck will be currency\nFriend: i copy pasted and it went boom\nFriend: xDD sorry\nPersona: #REF\nPersona: BOOM\nFriend: I'll replace your ignore ship\nPersona: cause this shit happens\nPersona: Thats why I dont like having multiple tables in one\nPersona: this is weird\nPersona: me too\nFriend: when you add a column something fucks up on my end\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: think its the same results\nFriend: check what I have on the right side after break-even\nFriend: dude your formula is so complicated\nFriend: should I factor shipping cost in max currency\nFriend: :D\nPersona: who would do that tho\nPersona: Or maybe not\nPersona: Make sure to have a tick box for \"Exclude shipping costs\" as sometime you may ship anyways.\nFriend: we don't have the cost anywhere\nFriend: lol\nyou need at least 4000 to break-even xD\n1250 ain't going far\nFriend: we can have further in this sheet a table where you can put in goods and it would help with the calculations of what you have maxed out and how much space is left :D\nFriend: not me tho\nFriend: I can see who has studied physics..\nPersona: Weight is also measured in Newtons\nPersona: Mass is mass\nPersona: Weight is mass * G\nPersona: its should be Mass\nPersona: Weight*\nPersona: It should not be called Wright\nPersona: Also Prun is dumb\nFriend: more productive than class I feel\nFriend: from 12 to 2:30 we did this magical thing\n\nsuch a productive day\nFriend: this is so sweet\nPersona: haha\nPersona: oh damn\nPersona: :DDDD\nFriend: dolar signs :D\nPersona: or it did?\nPersona: ok fuck\nPersona: it didnt;?\nFriend: that's a neat idea :D\nPersona: yeah\nFriend: so it should shift the bottleneck\nFriend: ok let's try that out\n\nwe can use the available weight and volume as a calculator then\nPersona: but few mass\nPersona: so I have a lot of volume available\nPersona: lets say I ship heavy Limestone\nPersona: it still may\nFriend: shouldn't have bottleneck\nFriend: PE has same weight/size tho\nPersona: has weight and different volume\nPersona: pretty much every good\nPersona: some good have diferent weight and volume\nPersona: there is\nFriend: have to have maybe 2 IFs on the bottleneck\n\ncause if the weight and size is the same, there isn't one\nFriend: I feel like doing this is helping me get better at economics\nI'm having reasoning! being a thinking human-being\nFriend: the break-even price should be used when you don't do full shipments\n\nbut if you can fill the ship, then profit/loss should be used\nFriend: can you see the column I made after break-even? It has the same value :D\nFriend: difference % and break-even price I think are 1:1 correlated\nFriend: nice :D we have the break-even now as well\nPersona: Ook this worked\nPersona: If i think about it more for 3 min and cant think of anything\nPersona: I'll do that\nFriend: yea\nFriend: you can do MAX(the2values) / MIN(the2values) instead\nPersona: Min max yah\nPersona: I like to find a sulution without IFS\nPersona: but\nPersona: yeah I can IF it\nFriend: MAX and MIN might help\nFriend: can you see the 100 125 having different results"
